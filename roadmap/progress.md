# Work-package record

The one list for the follow-on roadmap. Every package in
[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) has a row here, and the row is where its state
lives: the plan says what a package is for, this file says where it has got
to. Keep it current in the same pull request as the work.

## How to read a row

**Status** is one of:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_started` | Nothing merged. |
| `in_progress` | A branch exists. |
| `implemented` | Merged, CI green, tests present. The gate it serves may still be pending. |
| `validated` | Its acceptance criteria met with evidence linked from [validation/](validation/). |
| `blocked` | Waiting on something named in the row. |
| `superseded` | The need is met by something else; the row links to it and to the evidence that it meets the same criteria. |

**Classification** is what the reconciliation (ZF-001) found on `main` at
`6d12a72`: *existing, needs validation* means the capability is there and
the work is proving it; *extension* means the seam exists and the work
builds on it; *new* means there is nothing to extend.

**Session** records the Claude model and effort that did the work, whether it
ran as one session or an orchestration, and how many review rounds it took
before merge, so that [agent-models.md](agent-models.md) can be judged on
evidence.

## Phase 0: baseline

| ID | Package | Classification | Status | Depends on | Session | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZF-001 | Reconcile completed work and define the next slice | new | `implemented` | the improvement plan (done) | Claude Fable 5.1, `high`; one orchestration of 12 mappers, 12 adversarial verifiers and a document critic; 1 review round | [validation/baseline-6d12a72.md](validation/baseline-6d12a72.md); [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) §5–7 carry the classification of every package |
| ZF-002 | Support matrix, invariants and measurement contract | mixed | `implemented` | ZF-001 | docs as ZF-001; code slice: Claude Fable 5.1, `high`, one session, 1 review round | [support-and-measurement.md](support-and-measurement.md); the code slice is merged: readiness names the schema, a held job's timeline says so with `waiting` and `approved`, and the completed count is split four ways. `validated` waits on the owner's reference host (decision 12) for the recorded OS and runtime versions |
| ZF-003 | Supply-chain hygiene and three corrections | new; no behaviour change | `implemented` | nothing | Claude Fable 5.1, `high`, one session, 1 review round | every `uses:` in the four workflows is a commit with its release beside it; `.github/dependabot.yml` covers actions, Go modules, npm under `web/` and the images under `deploy/`, weekly and grouped; `govulncheck` runs on every change and weekly against `main`; the three pages say what the code does, and the payload carries `schema_version: 1`. `validated` when CI has run on the pins and the first Dependabot pull requests arrive |

## Phase 1: correctness and security under failure

| ID | Package | Classification | Status | Depends on | Session | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZF-101 | Enforce GitHub target boundaries everywhere | new (jobs carry no installation identity; label-only matching on all four paths) | `in_progress` | ZF-002 | PR1 and PR2: Claude Opus 5, `ultracode`; one orchestration of 8 subsystem mappers and 8 adversarial verifiers for PR1, a smaller one of 3 and 3 for PR2, each followed by one session | PR1 merged as #99: a job carries the installation covering its repository, `scheduler.Eligible` asks enabled, then installation, then labels, and all four matching paths go through it. Migration `0012` (not `0010`: 0010 and 0011 shipped since the plan was written). PR2 done: poll freshness and the rate-limit hold are both per installation, freshness credited by the delivery's repository rather than by the secret that verified it. Every behavioural test was run against the code with its rule removed and confirmed to fail first. PR3 (the runner-group warning and the hosts-and-pools section) remains |
| ZF-102 | Make runner and agent reconciliation convergent | mixed (mechanics exist; adoption on restart, a controller lock and the log-relay host check do not) | `in_progress` | ZF-002; N02 needs `main` deployed | PR1: Claude Fable 5.1, `xhigh`, one session; two mapping-and-verification orchestrations over the four packages | PR1 of 4 done: the "Reconciliation invariants" section in `docs/architecture.md` lists every rule with its constant and owner, and `internal/controller/invariants_test.go` pins the silence ladder and the lease-outlasts-work relationship. PR2 (log-relay host binding, state-directory lock and controller lease), PR3 (adoption on agent start) and PR4 (late reports and the restart table) remain |
| ZF-103 | Reserve host resources and enforce bounded admission | extension (slot model complete; no host resource reporting) | `not_started` | ZF-102 | | Size L; 103a before Gate F, 103b after |
| ZF-104 | Verify control-plane access and secret boundaries | mixed (matrix and most tests exist; log relay unscoped to host; streams never re-check credentials) | `not_started` | ZF-101, ZF-102 | | Size M |
| ZF-105 | Bound cleanup, retention and external failure handling | mixed (local cleanup exists; failure invisible; one listing-failure defect) | `in_progress` | ZF-102, except the first pull request | first slice: Claude Fable 5.1, `high`, one session, 1 review round | Size M; the listing-failure defect is fixed in its own pull request with a test that reproduces it on the old code |

## Phase 2: operable and usable

| ID | Package | Classification | Status | Depends on | Session | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZF-201 | Prove the first successful job through the UI | existing, needs validation, with two narrow extensions | `not_started` | ZF-101 | | Size M |
| ZF-202 | Actionable day-to-day diagnostics | mixed (substrate exists; no bundle, no per-job explanation) | `not_started` | ZF-102 | | Size L; its failing tie-break test is fixed in this pull request |
| ZF-203 | Implement and prove backup and restore | new (prose only today) | `not_started` | ZF-102 for automatic unfencing only | | Size L |
| ZF-204 | Safe releases, upgrades and version compatibility | mixed (skeleton exists; policy, skew, guards, backup-before-migrate and any upgrade test do not) | `not_started` | ZF-203 for the backup primitive; ZF-003 first | | Size L across small pull requests |
| ZF-205 | Usable telemetry and bounded history | mixed (substrate exists; four series, prune tests, a load fixture and the measurement do not) | `not_started` | ZF-002; ZF-101 and ZF-102 for the real latency series | | Size M in three slices |

## Phase 3: real use, drills and Gate F

| ID | Package | Classification | Status | Depends on | Session | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZF-301 | Extend the real end-to-end harness | mixed (one polling-mode test; no result categories, no cleanup ledger, no real container in any test) | `not_started` | ZF-002; 301c on the owner's credentials | | Size L in three slices; 301a and 301b ready now |
| ZF-302 | Restart and recovery drills | mixed (fake-level tests exist for every fault class but disk; no process-level drill) | `not_started` | ZF-301b | | Size S once 301b exists |
| ZF-303 | Controlled beta and the readiness record | new; owner-gated | `not_started` | everything above; the owner's deployment, credentials and second operator | | Size M for the template and helper; the observation is the owner's |

## Open items carried over from the improvement plan

| ID | What | Where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N02 | Runners stuck in `registering` on a dev instance; not reproducible on `main` | The first observation in ZF-303 on a deployment of `main`; `runners.not_progressing` now names which half it is. |
| D16 | The brand descriptor drawn into the wordmark | The owner's; not roadmap work. |

## Log

Newest first. One line per event that changed a row.

* 2026-09-07: ZF-101's second pull request, the poller made per-installation.
  The freshness question is answered from the delivery's repository, as the
  first pull request's record said it would have to be: a delivery credits the
  installation that owns the repository named in it, never the one whose secret
  verified it, so an installation whose secrets have drifted cannot be told to
  stand down on its neighbour's traffic. The rate-limit hold became a map and
  the sweep continues past a held installation. One thing worth knowing for the
  later slices: go-github caches an exhausted quota on the client, so a fake
  that sets the rate-limit headers globally rate-limits every installation at
  once; a test that wants one installation held has to use the 429 secondary
  form. The first draft of that test did not, and passed for the wrong reason.

  Two deliberate departures from the package's wording, recorded because the
  plan is the contract and the next reader should not have to rediscover them.
  The plan says "`LastAcceptedDeliveryAt` takes an installation"; instead it is
  left alone and a sibling added, because `Controller.Start` and the
  `pollingOnly` flag that ZF-202 keeps fleet-wide both still need the fleet-wide
  answer, and one query per sweep beats one per installation. The sibling is
  `InstallationsFreshSince`, bounded by the caller's own cutoff: asking for the
  last delivery per installation groups over every accepted row inside the
  retention window, which measured as a full scan of a week of history every
  thirty seconds, where the cutoff makes it an index range. And the plan says
  the tests need "two fakes"; one serves, because the fake's error injection is
  matched on the request path, so a repository-target installation can be
  rate-limited by its own path while its neighbour is not.

  One asymmetry the query inherits from the attribution rule, worth knowing
  before somebody reads it as a bug: where an organisation installation and a
  repository installation both cover a repository, only the repository one is
  credited, so an organisation whose only traffic is for a repository-scoped
  sibling looks silent and keeps being polled. That is the conservative
  direction -- poll rather than stand down -- and it is the same precedence
  every other part of ZF-101 uses.

* 2026-09-07: ZF-101's first pull request, the installation boundary. Three
  decisions taken inside decision 13's frame and recorded here because the
  later pull requests inherit them: a job is attributed to the installation
  covering its **repository**, never the one whose secret verified the
  delivery, which verification deliberately allows to be another's;
  `webhook_deliveries.installation_id` holds the **verifying** installation,
  because that is the one fact about a delivery which cannot be recomputed
  afterwards, and ZF-101's second pull request must therefore derive
  per-installation poll freshness from the repository rather than from that
  column; and the migration clears `matched` and `pool_id` on waiting and
  queued rows it re-attributes but leaves in-progress rows alone, because a
  running job's pool is the record of where it actually ran. The Jobs page
  carries the reason it can derive from the row itself -- the repository no
  installation covers -- and the cross-installation sentence reaches the
  operator through the problems drawer, which is where the scheduler's plan
  is read; a per-job reason on the Jobs page would be a new API field and is
  not in this pull request.

* 2026-09-06: ZF-102's first pull request, the invariants written down and pinned; the package is `in_progress`.

* 2026-09-06: ZF-003 done in one pull request; the package is `implemented`.

* 2026-09-06: ZF-002's code slice done; the package is `implemented`.

* 2026-09-06: ZF-105's first slice, the listing-failure defect in the agent
  reconciler, fixed with a test; the package is `in_progress`.

* 2026-09-06: every Phase 1 to 3 package classified from the package-by-package
  review (12 mappers, 12 adversarial verifiers, one document critic); ZF-003
  added; ZF-001 implemented; two Phase 0 defects fixed in the same pull
  request (the stuck-runner tie-break, the compatibility paragraph).
* 2026-09-06: record created from the reconciliation of the follow-on roadmap
  against `main` at `6d12a72`.

# Support matrix and measurement contract

The ZF-002 deliverable: one reference configuration the foundation is proved
on, an honest statement of what else is supported and to what degree, the
moments the platform must timestamp so that Gate F can be measured rather
than asserted, and the words *failure* and *severity* defined once.

Everything here is a proposal for the owner to ratify; the evidence it rests
on is in [validation/baseline-6d12a72.md](validation/baseline-6d12a72.md).

## RC1 measurement update

The RC1 fixes supersede the earlier measurement gaps below. First create task
issue is retained as `Runner.CreateTaskIssuedAt`, separately from the retry
clock. The new scheduling series pairs it with the actual job's eligibility;
GitHub approval holds are excluded, and an observed approval starts queue time.
Cleanup requires `HostRemovedAt` and `RegistrationDeletedAt`; its final stamp
is no longer a lower bound. Older estimates remain separately labelled.
`docs/metrics.md` defines the new series and the observations they exclude.

The owner has completed live qualification across selected repositories and
has explicitly removed a written qualification record as an RC1 prerequisite.
This does not manufacture a recorded seven-day observation window or claim
that the historical Gate F tables below have been measured.

## The reference configuration

| | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller | Linux amd64, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, `native` deployment under systemd | The only platform CI runs tests on, and what the installer was written against. |
| Agents | Linux amd64, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Docker backend, **rootless** daemon where the host offers one, rootful otherwise | The installer looks for a rootless socket first and the security posture assumes it; both must be exercised because most hosts still have only the rootful one. |
| Runner image | `ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner` at the pinned `actions/runner` release (2.337.0 on this commit), `pull_policy: if-not-present` | The image the docs tell people to use. |
| Topology under test | Two shapes, each in its own harness run: one VM with the embedded agent; a controller with one remote agent on a second host | The two deployment shapes the docs promise. The remote shape is what proves outbound-only agents, join tokens and host loss. |
| GitHub | github.com, a GitHub App installed on the owner's disposable organisation, with one repository-scoped and one organisation-scoped target | Both target kinds the docs support, because ZF-101's isolation tests need two installations. |
| Webhooks | A run with real delivery and a run on the poller alone | The harness today runs on the poller only. Real delivery needs a reachable URL; the tunnel or public host that provides it is part of the fixture. |

Everything else stays supported as it is documented today and is qualified
only to the degree a test proves:

| Configuration | Qualified for | Not qualified for | What would qualify it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux arm64 controller and agent | Build: CI cross-compiles and builds the arm64 images. Runtime: the Go suite and the lifecycle drill run on GitHub's hosted `ubuntu-24.04-arm` on every pull request, so a queued job becomes a real process on an arm64 machine and is cleaned up | Runtime with a container, and a real arm64 host in a fleet: the drill's runner is the stub, and the Docker backend has started no container on any architecture | An arm64 host in the real-runtime tier of the harness, which is a beta-testing item: the row moves when a job runs on an arm64 host somebody kept |
| Windows agent, `process` backend | Build: `windows/amd64` is cross-compiled in CI and shipped in every release; the whole tree vets on Windows, and the packages the agent is made of run their tests on GitHub's hosted `windows-latest` on every pull request. Shape: the `.zip` unpacker and its refusals, the digests for `win-x64` and `win-arm64`, the service manager's command line and its `sc.exe` calls, the removal retry | **Runtime: nothing in this repository has run actions/runner, joined a host, or started the service on a Windows machine.** The job object, the service control dispatcher, the disk and memory queries and the ProgramData defaults compile and have not been exercised. Windows on arm64 has digests and no build | A Windows host in the real-runtime tier of the harness, which is a beta-testing item: the row moves when a Windows host joins from the documented command and a queued job runs on it |
| **Docker backend** | Shape: the Engine API client, the create arguments, the DinD refusal, the cache suffix and the permission checks are unit-tested against a fake Engine | **Runtime: nothing in this repository has ever started a container.** It is the default backend, the one the docs tell people to use, and the reference configuration's own | A Docker daemon in the real-runtime tier of the harness (ZF-301c). This is the largest single gap in the qualification, and it is listed first because the table would otherwise read as though every unproven configuration were an exotic one |
| Podman backend | Shape: probe, defaults, DinD refusal and the SELinux cache suffix are unit-tested | Runtime: no test starts a Podman daemon | A Podman host in the harness |
| `process` backend | Shape: layout, signals, process groups, archive tamper check, JIT config off argv. Runtime: the drill tier runs the built binary as a real remote agent on this backend and watches a workload appear on the machine and go away | Runtime with the real runner: the drill's workload is a stub staged on disk, so nothing has yet run `actions/runner` itself | A bare host in the harness with the real runner tree; it is the least isolated backend and the docs already say so |
| macOS controller | Build; launchd plist rendering | Everything else; the docs say development only | Nothing planned |
| Debian, Fedora, Alpine hosts | Installer parses under `dash` and `shellcheck`; detection is unit-tested | No install runs on them in CI | One real install per distribution in the installer tier of the harness |
| `compose` and `docker` deployments | Templates are unit-tested; images build in CI | No CI job brings a deployment up and joins an agent to it | A compose-up smoke test in the harness |
| GitHub Enterprise Server | `github.api_base_url` is validated | No test speaks to a GHES | Access to a GHES; not in the first assignment |

Cross-compilation is not qualification. A row moves right only when a test
runs on the thing.

## The moments to timestamp

Gate F asks for two timings and one convergence, and each needs a start and an
end that the store records. The baseline lists the fields as they stood at
`6d12a72`; every gap it recorded has since been closed, so the table below is
the current answer and the baseline is history.

| Interval | Start | End | Today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GitHub queue wait** (not Zoomies' time) | GitHub's `started_at` on the job, absent for a queued job | `Job.QueuedAt` as first seen here | Reported by `JobEvent.Source`; the poller-only case inflates it and must be labelled |
| **Scheduling latency** | First observed eligibility after any GitHub approval hold | First create task issued in the host poll response | `Job.EligibleAt` and `Runner.CreateTaskIssuedAt` persist the exact endpoints. The new histogram uses the actual job/runner association; retries do not overwrite the end. Missing and prewarmed intervals are excluded. |
| **Configured scaling delay** (not Zoomies' time) | eligible | the scheduler's hold expires (`scheduler.scale_up_delay`, the start-failure backoff) | Reasons are in `ScalingEvent`. The new scheduling histogram includes this delay; report it separately when judging platform overhead |
| **Provisioning** | task issued | `Runner.ContainerStartedAt` | Exists; `Runner.ImagePullDuration` separates the pull where the backend can |
| **Registration** | `Runner.ContainerStartedAt` | `Runner.RegisteredAt` | Exists |
| **Assignment** (GitHub's decision, not Zoomies') | `Runner.RegisteredAt` | `Job.StartedAt` | Exists; GitHub may hand the job to a different idle runner, which the contract accepts and reports as *ran elsewhere in the fleet* |
| **Execution** | `Job.StartedAt` | `Job.CompletedAt` | Exists |
| **Cleanup convergence** | `Runner.FinishedAt`, with configured retention reported separately | Both host removal and GitHub registration absence confirmed | `HostRemovedAt`, `RegistrationDeletedAt` and `CleanedUpAt` provide positive confirmations. Historical `CleanupEstimatedAt` values are estimates only. |

Two smaller gaps the reconciliation found belonged to Phase 0 itself because
they needed no migration, and the code for both has landed. A job GitHub holds
for a deployment review is `waiting`, and the hold and its release now have
timeline kinds of their own — `waiting` and `approved`, written by the existing
job-change path — so a held job's timeline says whose time the review was. The
RC1 change moves the queue start when an observed approval changes a waiting
job to queued, and keeps that boundary on replays. `Stats` is split four ways
— succeeded, failed, cancelled and unknown — so a `stale` or empty conclusion
is no longer counted as a success.

Two rules go with the table. Every rate has a denominator written beside it,
and an observation the platform did not see (a job that completed while the
controller was down and was learned about later) is *unknown*, never
*success*. And a failure is attributed to Zoomies only when the platform's own
record says so: `Job.RunnerFault` set, a `runner_lost` event, a runner that
went `failed` before a job started, or a cleanup that did not converge. A
workflow whose steps failed is the workflow's business.

## Counters

The metrics page already exposes fleet counts. The contract adds, per pool
and per installation: jobs observed, eligible, created for, ran here, ran
elsewhere in the fleet, ran on another provider, failed with a Zoomies fault,
cleanup pending, cleanup converged. Names and label cardinality are ZF-205's
to settle; the counts are what Gate F is computed from.

## Severity

| Severity | Definition | Gate F |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Compromise of a credential, a host or another job's data; loss of fleet state | Zero unresolved |
| **High** | A job the platform should have run did not, or was lost, with no reasonable workaround; a recovery path that needs database surgery | Zero unresolved |
| **Medium** | A reasonable workaround exists, or the effect is confined to diagnostics, timing or one deployment shape | Counted and listed |
| **Low** | Cosmetic, copy, or a limitation the docs already state | Listed |

## Gate F targets as adopted

| Target | As proposed | Adopted | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observation | 7 consecutive days, 200 representative attempts | 7 days, 200 attempts, of which at least 20 intended failures and 20 cancellations, and at least three bursts in which the queued jobs exceed the fleet's total capacity | 200 attempts over 7 days is about 29 a day and never exercises contention on its own; the bursts are what prove scheduling under load rather than elapsed time |
| Denominator | "eligible controlled attempts" | completed jobs on non-demo installations whose runner this controller created; `waiting` jobs and jobs GitHub dispatched elsewhere are counted and reported but excluded | The seeded demo installation has no GitHub behind it and must never appear in a count; `retention.runners` defaults to 7 days, so raise it on the reference instance or export evidence daily |
| Outcome rate | ≥ 99% of eligible attempts reach the expected terminal outcome without a Zoomies-caused failure | same; a Zoomies-caused failure is `Job.RunnerFault` set, or a runner that failed before registration for a job that then ran elsewhere or expired | 200 attempts allows two Zoomies faults; report the count, not only the percentage |
| Scheduling latency | p95 ≤ 10 s from eligible to create task issued, with capacity and a prepared image | p95 ≤ `scheduler.interval` + 2 s from the later of the delivery's receipt and eligibility to the create task being issued, reported beside the interval it ran at | With the default 10 s interval, the wait for the next tick alone is uniform over 0 to 10 s and its p95 is about 9.5 s before any processing, so the figure as proposed fails by construction or passes by noise. The reference run may use a 5 s interval and keep 10 s if the owner prefers the round number |
| Cleanup convergence | within 5 min of the retention deadline with dependencies healthy; offline hosts converge within 5 min of recovery | same; use confirmed `Runner.CleanedUpAt`, never the historical estimate | Subtract configured retention from the finish-to-confirmation interval when assessing this target. |
| Restore | demonstrated on a clean environment; reference target 30 min | same | Record the achieved time and the backup's age |
| Second operator | completes setup and diagnoses an injected failure from the docs and UI | same | Cannot be produced by the agent; the gate stays pending until a person does it |
| Defects | zero unresolved critical or high; zero unexplained lost jobs; zero cross-scope access | same | |

None of these are commitments to anyone outside the project. They are what
"good enough to call it a trusted-workload beta" means here.

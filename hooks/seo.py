"""Build-time SEO metadata for zoomies.sh.

Two things the site wants that MkDocs does not know by itself, both derived
from the repository rather than written by hand, so neither can go stale:

* **A real last-modified date per page.** MkDocs' own sitemap stamps every URL
  with the build date, which tells a crawler that the whole site changed every
  time anything did -- exactly the signal that makes freshness meaningless. The
  date a page was last edited is in git, so it is taken from there and put on
  ``page.meta.git_date`` for ``overrides/sitemap.xml`` and the sharing tags.

* **``llms.txt``**, the plain-text index an assistant fetches when it is asked
  about a project instead of crawling it. It is generated from the navigation,
  so a page added to ``mkdocs.yml`` appears in it without anyone remembering.

This is a hook rather than a plugin because it needs nothing a plugin would
bring: the docs build stays at the three pinned dependencies in
``docs/requirements.txt``.

The git call is one process for the whole repository, not one per page. A
shallow checkout has no history to read, so the dates come back empty and every
page falls back to the build date -- which is why the site workflow checks out
with ``fetch-depth: 0``.

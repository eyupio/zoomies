// Allocation is what one runner of p is limited to when it is created on h,
// and where those limits came from.
//
// It is the enforcement half of the resource model, and it closes the gap the
// charge left open. Reserve charges a pool that sets no limit one slot's share
// of the host, so the books balance -- and until now the runner itself was
// given no limit at all, so the books balanced while eight runners each took
// every core on the machine. A pool's own limits win where it set them; where
// it did not, the runner is given exactly what it was charged, as a cgroup
// limit the container backends apply.
//
// It is per field, as Reserve is, and for the same reason: a pool that sets
// memory and leaves CPU alone has said something about memory and nothing
// about CPU. Disk and the pids limit pass through untouched -- disk has no
// share to give (it is a measurement, not a budget) and a pids limit is not a
// thing the machine's size says anything about.
//
// A docker-in-docker runner's sidecar is given what this function hands back
// as spec.Resources, and what that is depends on where the figure came from.
// A limit an operator typed is given to both containers in full -- the build
// runs in the daemon, so it needs the same figure the runner was promised --
// and Reserve charges the host for both. A defaulted figure is one slot's
// share, and store.Resources.SplitWithDaemon divides it between the pair
// before either container is created, because a slot is one runner however
// many containers it takes to run it; Reserve charges one share to match.
//
// A slot too small to give both halves what a runner needs is refused rather
// than divided -- see ShareFloor -- because handing the daemon whatever is
// left over is no limit at all, which is how one build takes the machine.
//
// A default is only given where it would bind. The process backend applies no
// limit at all, so a defaulted figure on one of its runners would be a number
// on the Runners page saying the opposite of the truth. And a daemon that
// cannot apply a CPU quota -- rootless Docker on a host that delegates only
// memory and pids to the user -- refuses the container rather than ignoring
// the request, so a default sent there would fail every create on the host.
// The host's own probe says what its daemon can do, and a probe from an agent
// too old to say is read as "nothing", which is what every host did before.
//
// With defaults off the pool's limits are the whole answer, which is what
// every fleet had before this existed.

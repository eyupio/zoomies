	// sample before its throttle is lifted anyway. The measurements the
	// ladder climbs on have stopped coming -- an agent downgraded to a build
	// that does not send them, or a host that went away -- and a host that
	// cannot be measured is placed by its configured capacity, exactly as the

// Three things can be true of a host with a fresh sample. It is overwhelmed:
// the CPU hold has tripped, the load average is past twice its cores, or its
// memory is at the reserve -- and then it climbs a rung, if ThrottleStep has
// passed since the last one. It is calm: CPU under 85%, load under one per
// core, memory above the reserve -- and then a calm streak runs, and after
// ThrottleRecovery it climbs down a rung and the streak starts again. Or it
// is neither, in the band between, where the rung is kept and the streak is
// broken: a host at 90% CPU is not overwhelmed, and it is not a host to give
// slots back to either.
//
// Without a fresh sample nothing moves, until StaleThrottleReset has passed
// since the last one; then the throttle is lifted, because a host nobody can

// throttle a healthy host, watch it calm down, lift the throttle and throttle
// it again, for ever. So the CPU hold counts only while the host carries a
// runner with no quota -- the one kind of runner that can take more than its
// share -- and the load average is what says a host has been pushed past its
// cores by anything at all, quotas included: CFS dequeues a throttled task, so
// load climbs past the core count only when more is runnable than the plan

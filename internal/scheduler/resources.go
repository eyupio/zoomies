// half taught agents to measure their machines, and this is what decides that
// the ninth 4 GB runner does not go on a 32 GB box.
//
// It is a charge, not an enforcement. What actually binds a runner is the
// cgroup limit the container backend applies from the same pool `resources`,
// and the process backend applies none at all -- so a reservation says what
// the fleet has promised away, and only the container backends make the
// promise true.

// Reserve is what one runner of p costs on h.

// It is pure, and it is per field. A pool that sets a memory limit and no CPU
// limit has said something about memory and nothing about CPU, so the limit
// answers for memory and the fallback answers for CPU; charging zero for the
// half the operator left alone would let a fleet promise away a machine it had
// measured.
//
// The fallback is the host's own allocatable share per slot, and it is chosen
// so that nothing changes on upgrade: a host carrying only pools with no
// limits charges each runner exactly one slot's worth, so its capacity is what
// admits work, exactly as it did before any of this existed.
//
// Disk has no fallback. Free disk is a measurement rather than a budget, and
// dividing what is left into shares would turn every fill of the cache into a
// refusal to place work that had always placed. What guards it instead is the
// reserve floor: a pool that asks for disk is charged it, and a host at or
// below its reserve takes nothing.
//
// A docker-in-docker runner is two containers, and what it is charged follows
// what the two are given. A limit an operator typed says what the job may
// have; the daemon is given the same, so the pair is charged twice, and a host
// too small for what was typed says so. A fallback share is the machine cut
// into slots, and there the pair splits one slot between them -- see
// store.Resources.SplitWithDaemon -- so it is charged one.
//
// Both halves of that have to stay true together. Charging one share while
// giving each container a whole one is the bug this once had: a host read as
// half committed while its containers' quotas added up to every core it had,
// the daemon lost the reserve the arithmetic said was being kept for it, and
// creates timed out on a machine the fleet believed was idle. Giving the pair
// one share while charging two is the mirror of it, and is what an operator
// meets as a fleet that will not use the machines it has: eight slots that
// hold four runners, a page promising room the pass refuses, and an
// overcommit warning whose advice -- fewer slots -- makes it worse every time
// it is taken, down to one slot holding nothing at all.

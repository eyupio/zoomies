// Package migrate rewrites the `runs-on` lines in GitHub Actions workflows so
// that a repository's jobs run on a Zoomies pool instead of on GitHub's hosted
// runners.
//
// It is the engine behind the migration wizard: the wizard reads a
// repository's workflows, asks this package what it would change, shows the
// operator the diff, and -- only then -- opens a pull request with the result.
//
// # Why this is not a YAML round trip
//
// The obvious implementation is to unmarshal the workflow, replace the value
// and marshal it back. It produces an unreviewable pull request: comments are
// dropped, key order is normalised, quoting style changes, block scalars are
// reflowed, and anchors are expanded. A workflow is a file a team has written
// and rewritten by hand, and a migration that reformats all of it hides the
// one line that actually changed.
//
// So the rewriting is line-based and surgical. It finds `runs-on` keys, edits
// the value, and leaves every other byte -- indentation, comments, trailing
// whitespace, line endings -- exactly as it found it. What it cannot rewrite
// with confidence it refuses to touch and reports as a skip, because a wrong
// rewrite sends a job to a runner that does not exist and the workflow simply
// hangs.

// jobTracker names the job a `runs-on` belongs to by watching indentation.
//
// It is deliberately approximate. It exists so the wizard can say "build" next
// to a change rather than "line 34", and so an Override has something to name
// -- but a wrong guess still cannot produce a wrong rewrite, because the diff
// the operator approves is built by this same attribution. An override that
// lands on a job the tracker misread shows up as a diff on that job, on the
// screen, before anything is written.
//
// It is also why an override keys on a job name rather than a line number. The
// apply step re-reads the file from GitHub, and a name that no longer exists
// simply falls back to the consolidated mapping, where a line that has shifted
// would point somewhere new.

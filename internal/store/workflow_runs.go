// reported under one run, summed up into the row the Workflows page lists. It
// is the "#1009" an operator finds in GitHub's Actions tab, so the two can be
// read side by side.
//
// It is derived, never stored. Only workflow_job deliveries are ingested, so
// everything known about a run is what its jobs said, and a row of its own
// would be one more thing for a late or missing delivery to leave stale. The
// summary is over the latest attempt of each job name, which is what GitHub's
// own run page shows: re-running the failed jobs writes new job rows under the
// same run, and a run whose second attempt passed is a run that passed.

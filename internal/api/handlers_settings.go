// The settings surface.
//
// Every configuration key except the three that get the database open lives in
// the database, so this is where an administrator changes the fleet rather than
// where they are told to go and edit a file on the controller's host. Two
// things follow from that, and both are the point:
//
// A change is kept. It used to be that a PATCH altered the running process and
// nothing else, so a setting that was also in zoomies.yaml quietly went back to
// the file's value at the next restart -- the API said so in as many words, and
// it was still a surprise every time. Now the value is written, and the file is
// a layer underneath it.
//
// A change that cannot be applied now is still accepted. Rebinding a listener
// under live connections is not something a process can do to itself, so
// server.bind is stored and reported in pending_restart instead of refused.
// Refusing it never stopped anybody wanting it changed; it only moved the work
// to a text editor and left no record that anyone had asked.
//
// What is refused is a change that would not survive: a key an environment
// variable is pinning would be written, overridden at the next start, and
// appear to have been forgotten. The refusal names the variable.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The shapes
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// settingView is one configuration key as the settings page sees it: what it
// is, what it is set to, where that value came from, and whether this
// administrator can change it here.
//
// It is generated from the registry in internal/config rather than written out
// by hand. The lists it replaces -- the fourteen keys the API would write, the
// forty-seven it would refuse, the nested map it rendered from, and the two
// constants the browser kept -- were four hand-maintained copies of one fact,
// and all four had drifted.

// The refusals that keep a host's settings and a pool's requirements from
// being edited into contradiction.
//
// Both are 409 rather than 422, for the reason ErrConfirmationRequired is:
// the request is well formed and it is the rest of the fleet that decides. An
// operator shrinking a host before they delete the pool that used it is right,
// so neither refusal is final -- each says what would be stranded, and each
// says how to mean it anyway.
//
// The sentence names the pool, the machine and the shortfall, because those
// three are the whole decision. "That would strand a pool" sends an operator
// to compare two forms on two pages by eye, which is the work this check
// exists to do for them.

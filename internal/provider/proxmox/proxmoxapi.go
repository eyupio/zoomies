package proxmox

// This file is a small, hand-written client for the Proxmox VE API.
//
// Why not a Proxmox SDK? The same argument internal/backend/dockerapi.go makes
// about github.com/docker/docker, with a weaker case for the dependency: this
// integration touches about a dozen endpoints, there is no pagination, there is
// one error shape, and no second consumer to amortise a vendored SDK over.
// Zoomies is a single binary an operator downloads and runs, so its dependency
// tree is part of its user interface -- every module in it is something they
// have to trust, audit and rebuild when a CVE lands. The API is a documented
// REST interface over HTTPS with one authentication header, so speaking it with
// net/http costs one file.
//
// The parts that are genuinely fiddly are implemented here once and unit
// tested: the task handle (upid.go), the wire's habit of writing numbers as
// strings and booleans as 0 or 1, and -- the one that decides whether this
// fleet pays for a machine nobody is tracking -- telling a request that never
// left from one whose answer never came back.

package proxmox

// The provider itself: everything internal/provider asks of an infrastructure
// provider, spoken to one Proxmox VE cluster.
//
// Three things about the shape of this file are decided by the Proxmox API
// rather than by taste, and are what to understand before changing it.
//
//   - A clone is asynchronous and holds a lock on the new guest until it
//     finishes, so nothing can be sized, tagged or started while it runs.
//     Create therefore does the one thing that can be done in a single call --
//     the clone, carrying the guest's name and its ownership record, both of
//     which the clone endpoint accepts -- and hands back the task handle.
//     Sizing, tagging and starting belong to Start, which runs at the first
//     moment the guest is unlocked.
//   - Start is given a ref and no spec, so the shape a machine was asked for
//     has to survive the gap between the two calls without living in this
//     process's memory: a controller may restart in between, and a machine
//     that came back the template's size rather than the operator's would be
//     wrong in a way nothing would ever report. It travels in the guest's own
//     description, beside the ownership record, and is read back there.
//   - Nothing here waits for a task. Every call returns as soon as the cluster
//     has taken the work, and the UPID it returns is what follows it, because
//     one reconcile step is budgeted for about two requests and a full clone
//     takes minutes. The one exception is the guest agent, which has no task
//     to hand back at all; bootstrap.go says what it does instead.
//
// Nothing in this package decides how many machines should exist, when to give
// up or what may be deleted. That is one reconciler's job for every provider.

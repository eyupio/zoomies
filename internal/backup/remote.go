// A backup that leaves the machine.
//
// A copy beside the database is a backup against a mistake: a bad migration, a
// deletion somebody regrets, an upgrade that went sideways. It is not a backup
// against the disk, the machine or the datacentre, and a directory of tidy
// copies on the volume that just died is the worst kind of backup because
// everyone believed in it.
//
// So a remote is one S3-compatible bucket, and what goes into it is exactly
// the file the Backups tab downloads: the same gzipped tar of the manifest,
// the database and -- only when the backup was taken with it -- the key,
// optionally sealed with the same argon2id and AES-256-GCM. One archive
// format, whether it was downloaded by a browser, copied by hand or put there
// by the fleet, so a copy pulled out of a bucket three years from now opens
// with `zoomies restore` and nothing else.

// hand, and a manifest written by the controller says the same things in the
// same fields as one written on a host where the controller will not start.
//
// A backup here is a directory: the database, copied with VACUUM INTO so that
// it is one whole file with no write-ahead log beside it, and a manifest saying
// which build wrote it, how far the schema had got, which encryption key opens
// it, what that key is needed for, and what the instance was configured to be.
// The encryption key itself is never in there unless it was asked for, because
// a backup that carries its own key is a credential rather than a copy.

// deploymentSettings is the configuration the deployment being upgraded runs
// with: its file, its database and its environment, layered as its controller
// layers them at start (config.Effective).
//
// The database is the point. Settings are kept there -- the settings page
// writes nowhere else -- so whether this host runs runners, on which backend
// and through which socket is a question for the deployment's database, and a
// file or .env read on its own answers it wrongly the moment an operator has
// used the page. The upgrade reads it read-only, which is safe beside the
// running controller for the same reason a backup is.
//
// read is false when the database could not be read, and why says what
// stood in the way; cfg is then what the file and environment say over the
// defaults, and the caller must treat anything the database could have
// changed as unknown rather than as that.

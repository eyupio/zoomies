// Package installer is the interactive setup behind `zoomies init`,
// `zoomies uninstall` and `zoomies agent join`.
//
// The goal it is written against is a specific one: take a fresh Ubuntu,
// Debian, Fedora or Alpine host -- or macOS, for a development controller --
// from nothing to a running controller with a registered GitHub App, in one
// sitting, without the operator having to read the documentation first.
//
// Two rules shape the code. The first is that install.sh has already detected
// the host, so nothing here asks a question the script answered. The second is
// that the prompting is deliberately thin: every decision lives in a plain
// function that takes a struct and returns a struct, and the huh forms only
// fill that struct in. That is what makes the unattended path the same code as
// the interactive one rather than a second implementation that drifts.

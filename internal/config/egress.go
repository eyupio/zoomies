// CheckOutboundURL refuses a URL this process would dial on an operator's

//
// It exists because a setting that holds a URL is a setting that makes the
// controller send a request wherever it points. An administrator who may set
// oidc.issuer may otherwise point it at 169.254.169.254 and read the cloud
// credentials of the machine the controller runs on out of the error message,
// or at a service on the LAN that trusts anything from inside it. Those are
// the platform's resources, not the fleet's, which is why the switch that
// permits them is platform-scoped.
//
// The check reads the address it is given and resolves nothing. A validator
// cannot resolve DNS honestly: the answer at startup need not be the answer at
// the next request, and a name the operator does not control can be pointed at
// 10.0.0.1 afterwards. So an IP literal and the handful of names that can only
// be local are refused, and any other host name is admitted on trust.
// docs/security.md says so rather than letting this read as a network policy.
//
// setting names the key being checked, so the finding points at the value to
// change as well as at the switch that would allow it. The finding is an
// error, which is what a write through the API refuses with; the validator
// lowers it to a warning, because a value in the file is the process owner's
// and an upgrade must not stop an install that works.

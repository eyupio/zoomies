// The database layer: stored rows applied onto a configuration, and a
// configuration's values encoded back into rows.
//
// This is the layer between the file and the environment, and the one an
// administrator changes from the UI. It is applied after the store is open and
// the encryption key is loaded, which is the earliest moment a sealed value can
// be read -- and which is why the three keys that get the store open and the
// key loaded cannot themselves live here.

// ApplyStored writes stored settings onto cfg and records that they came from
// the database.
//
// A row that this build cannot use does not stop startup. A downgrade is the
// ordinary way to meet one -- an operator who set something in a newer version
// and rolled back -- and refusing to boot over a setting the older binary never
// had would turn "the new feature is not available" into "the controller is
// down". Each one becomes a finding instead, so the row is still named and
// still recoverable, and the fleet keeps running on the value underneath.
//
// It never mutates a slice or map the previous snapshot shares: every list and
// label set is rebuilt, which is what makes this safe to call inside a
// config.Live update.

// The settings registry: one row per configuration key, and the single answer
// to every question the rest of the product asks about a setting.
//
// There used to be five answers. The struct's yaml tags said what the keys
// were, applyEnv said what their environment variables were, the settings API
// kept a map of the fourteen it would write and a list of the forty-five it
// would refuse, the browser kept a third list of prefixes it would offer an
// editor for, and docs/configuration.md described the lot by hand. Every one
// of them was maintained separately, so every one of them drifted:
// scheduler.drain_timeout, scheduler.default_runner_limits,
// scheduler.host_throttling, server.allow_indexing, github.upload_base_url and
// all five capacity_demand keys existed in the struct and in the environment
// and in neither API list, which made a PATCH for any of them answer "not a
// setting this API knows about" for a setting this API plainly had.
//
// So there is one list now, and it is this one. applyEnv walks it, the database
// layer walks it, the settings API renders and stages from it, the browser
// draws its editors from what the API publishes out of it, and a test in
// internal/docs fails if a key in it has no row in docs/configuration.md. A key
// added to Config without a row here fails TestEverySettingIsRegistered on the
// day it is added rather than after a release.

// Kind classifies a setting's value for the code that has to parse, store and
// render it without knowing which struct field is behind it.

// Everything here follows one rule, and it is worth stating before any of the
// code: every arrow between two machine states is an OBSERVATION, never an
// intent. A create whose answer never arrived is resolved by asking the
// provider about the identity the row already carries, never by creating a
// second machine; a delete is complete when an inspect cannot find the
// resource, never when the delete call returned 200. A controller that guessed
// in either direction would leave somebody paying for a machine nothing in the
// fleet knows about, which is the failure this whole design is arranged around.
//
// The loop is its own spawn rather than a step of Reconcile. reconcileMu is
// held for a whole scheduling pass and a clone takes minutes, so a machine step
// inside it would stop the fleet placing runners for as long as a hypervisor
// felt like taking -- the argument that already moved capacity-demand delivery

// The views are the resources as the API documents them: a host with its
// health worked out, a runner with its pool and host named, a pool with its
// counts, a job with its waits measured.
//
// They live here rather than in internal/api because two transports render
// them. The REST handlers do, and so does the event stream -- and the stream
// is fed from this package, at the moment a row changes. When the two rendered
// different shapes, a `host.updated` frame carried a store row with no
// `healthy` field, so the one event that exists to say "this agent has gone
// quiet" repainted the host as healthy. One renderer, used by both, is what
// stops the cache the UI keeps from being wrong the moment an event lands.
// controller.Stats and controller.Problem already worked this way; these
// follow them.

// what a demo wants. The demo deliberately keeps its two starting runners young
// (see freshenDemoRunners) so an instance left open never reports a fault in a
// fleet that has no agent to have one. Every diagnostic this project has for a
// fleet in trouble -- the problems drawer, the stuck-runner shapes, the blocked
// pool, the held job -- is therefore unreachable from the demo, which is why
// they went untested until this existed.

// operator opens on their worst day.

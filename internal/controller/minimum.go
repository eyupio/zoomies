// EffectiveMinimum is the minimum size a pool's runners are actually held to:
// the pool's own figure on a field where it set one, and otherwise the fleet's
// runners.minimum_cpus / runners.minimum_memory_mb.
//
// The fleet figure is read live rather than copied into the pool when it is
// created, so changing it moves every pool that never said otherwise on the
// next pass -- and saving a pool never freezes today's value into it. A fleet
// minimum at or above a pool's typed standard size means nothing for that pool
// (the same rule the wizard's opening value follows), and is ignored there. On
// an automatic field it applies as-is: the scheduler already caps a minimum at
// the slot's share.

// settings: a copy written back would turn "the fleet's figure" into a figure
// of the pool's own, and the fleet setting would stop moving it.

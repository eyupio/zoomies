// fleet with no backup, so the controller takes one itself on the interval
// backup.interval sets, into the directory backup.directory names, and keeps
// backup.keep of them. It is the same copy `zoomies backup` writes and the
// settings page takes on demand: one layout, one manifest, one restore.
//
// A backup beside the database is a backup against a mistake and not against
// the disk, which is why a backup here is an event rather than a file. The
// whole of the event is: take the copy, apply retention to the directory, and
// reconcile every destination backup.remotes names. Whichever of the three
// asked for it gets all of it, because "the copy left the machine" is not
// something an operator should have to press a second button for and then
// remember to.

// Package controller is the wiring between everything else: it owns the
// reconcile loop, the GitHub client cache, webhook ingest, the agent task
// queue, the log relay and the background housekeeping.
//
// Nothing in here decides how many runners a pool should have -- that is
// internal/scheduler, and it is a pure function -- and nothing in here writes
// SQL, which is internal/store. What this package does is turn a decision into
// GitHub calls, database rows and tasks for an agent, in an order that leaves
// the fleet in a defensible state when any single step fails.
//
// The controller never dials an agent. Agents connect outbound, long-poll for
// tasks and POST their results, which is why the task queue and the log relay
// are shaped the way they are.

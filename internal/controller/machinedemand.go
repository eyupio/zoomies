// DecideMachines is the machine-side twin of scheduler.Decide: it reads a
// snapshot of the fleet and answers how many machines each provider should be
// renting. It is pure -- no clock read, no database, no provider call, no
// randomness -- and it mutates nothing it was handed, so the whole of what a
// fleet decides to spend money on is reproducible in a table test and
// explainable in the sentence each decision carries.
//
// It lives here rather than in internal/scheduler because the scheduler is
// about placing runners on hosts that already exist, and this is about whether
// a host should exist at all: it reads provider and machine rows the scheduler
// knows nothing about, and it must not teach that package about either.
//
// What it does not do is form a second opinion. Which hosts could run a pool is
// scheduler.HostCanRun's answer and which pool claims a queued job is
// scheduler.BestPool's, because a copy of either rule would drift from the one
// that actually places the work, and a fleet that bought machines by one rule
// and refused to use them by another would pay for hosts that never run a job.
//
// The four ways it refuses to count the same capacity twice are stated where
// each one happens: the synthetic host, the shared slot ledger, ready machines,
// and the single claim on a queued job.

// MachineLimits are the fleet-wide bounds, gathered from configuration by the
// caller so that nothing in this file reads configuration for itself.

// the one number that decides the size of an invoice is not allowed to mean

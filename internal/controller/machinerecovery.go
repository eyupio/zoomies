// Recovery is not a startup path. It runs before demand on every pass, so a
// controller that has just come back is simply having the pass where nothing
// was in memory: the rows say what was being done, the provider says what
// actually happened, and the difference between the two is resolved by asking
// rather than by acting. A separate "recover once at start" path would be code
// that runs on the rarest occasion and is therefore never right.
//
// What this file does is the half of recovery that asks nothing of a provider:
// reservations that expired, phases that have run out of time, and the paced
// ownership sweep. The half that needs a provider call is the step function's,
// because a machine whose create was lost is resolved by exactly the same
// Inspect whether the controller restarted or merely blinked.

// recoverMachineOperations walks the machines with unfinished work and settles
// what can be settled from the rows alone.

// stuck behind an unreachable node must not starve the rest, and a fleet with a

//   - a resource wearing our marks with a row is verified, and nothing more;
//   - a resource wearing our name grammar with no row at all is an UNTRACKED
//     resource: reported, listed on the orphan page, and never deleted;
//   - a resource whose marks name another machine is a quarantine, not a
//     delete;
//   - a row whose resource is absent is confirmed gone only when the row was
//     already being deleted, and otherwise says so and drains the host.
//
// Anything live and unexplained is left alone. That is reap's rule about GitHub
// registrations, applied where the mistake costs a running machine.
// sweepTimeout is one provider's sweep budget.
//
// A call apiece, because a sweep is a listing plus a read per candidate rather
// than the two requests stepTimeout budgets for -- Proxmox reads one
// configuration per guest in the range to find its marks. Never longer than the

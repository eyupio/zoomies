// heartbeat timeout, the heartbeat timeout against the interval the controller
// hands the agent, every task lease against the time the agent gives itself to
// do that task. Until now nothing but a comment held those pairs together, so
// a change to one side did not have to say what it did to the other. These
// tests are the section of the same name in docs/architecture.md, made to
// fail.

// A host passes through two judgements as it goes quiet, and they have to come
// in this order: late (one missed heartbeat is nothing), then unhealthy (the
// scheduler stops placing runners on it), then lost (the runners already on
// it are failed so a pool can replace them). Unhealthy before late would fail
// healthy hosts on every hiccup; lost before unhealthy would destroy runners
// on a host the scheduler was still placing new ones on.

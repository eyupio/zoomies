// The throttle is decided in the scheduler (NextThrottle, pure) and applied
// here, from two places: every heartbeat, which is where a fresh measurement
// arrives, and the housekeeping pass, which is what lifts a throttle whose
// host has stopped sending measurements at all. Both go through settleThrottle
// so that a step is persisted, logged, audited and published in exactly one
// way -- a rung the Hosts page showed and the audit trail did not would be a
// decision nobody could account for afterwards.

// settleThrottle runs the ladder for one host as it stands now and records
// whatever moved. It reports whether the rung changed.
//
// h is updated in place, so a caller that goes on to render or answer with
// the host sees the rung it is actually on. A change that moves no rung -- a
// calm streak starting -- is persisted and published but neither logged nor
// audited: the streak is bookkeeping for the next step down, and a log line
// per heartbeat about a host that is merely recovering would bury the lines
// about the ones that are not.

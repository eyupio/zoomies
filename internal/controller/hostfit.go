// HostFit is what the pool wizard asks before a pool exists: how many hosts
// could run it as configured, and, when none can, the first host's own account
// of why and the backends those hosts do offer.
//
// Zero is worth saying out loud before a pool is created: a pool whose
// selector matches nothing looks completely healthy and never starts a runner.
// The explanation matters as much as the count, because the usual cause is not
// a missing machine but a daemon the agent on an existing one could not reach,
// and the backends those same hosts do offer are the other way out.

	// not the machine the pool asked for. It is called out separately because
	// it is the one mismatch no backend change can fix: the answer is a
	// different host, or a different platform on the pool.
	PlatformMismatch int
	// Selected is how many hosts the pool's host selector reaches at all,
	// whatever became of them afterwards. It is the number the wizard's
	// placement step shows while a selector is being typed, and Count is the
	// number its review step shows -- so when the two differ, something
	// happened between them that an operator has to be told about.
	Selected int
	// Excluded is that difference, host by host: everything the selector
	// reaches and the fleet cannot run, with the reason in the operator's
	// terms. It is what turns "2 hosts match" followed by "1 host can run
	// this pool" from a contradiction into an explanation.
	Excluded []HostExclusion
	// Reduced are hosts that can run the pool, counted in Count, where its

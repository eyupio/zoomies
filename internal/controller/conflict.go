// A host's settings and a pool's requirements are two halves of one sentence,
// and they are edited on different pages by people who cannot see the other
// half. Raising a host's memory reserve is arithmetic on the Hosts page and a
// pool with nowhere to run on the Pools page; asking a pool for two more cores
// is one number on a form and a fleet that has none. Either way the fleet
// stays green, the scheduler keeps deciding correctly, and the only symptom is
// a job that queues for an hour.
//
// So both edits are checked against the other half before they are saved, and
// an edit that takes away the last host a pool could ever run on is refused
// until the operator says they meant it. The check is deliberately narrow: it
// asks only whether a pool that has somewhere to run would stop having one.
// A pool that is already stranded is not made worse by the next edit, and a
// pool that keeps one home is not the operator's problem today.

// Stranding is one pool an edit would leave with no host in the fleet that
// could ever run it, and the refusal that is the nearest miss -- a host that
// could run it before the edit and could not after, with that host's own
// account of why. The name is the operator's way in: a code is something to
// group by, and the machine that stopped fitting is the one to go and look at.

// are worked out here after every reconcile pass and every housekeeping tick,
// and published only when the JSON actually differs from what was last sent.

// is connected to the stream: a controller nobody is watching should not do

// The two numbers an operator actually reads off the Hosts page are the two
// nothing announces. `active_runners` is counted from the runners table when a
// host is read, so a runner starting moves the "4 of 6 slots in use" bar with
// no host row written and nothing to publish; and the heartbeat behind "last
// heartbeat 12s ago" is a bare UPDATE of one column that no publisher watches.
// Both sat still until the browser reconciled, which is why the page felt dead
// while the fleet moved underneath it -- the operator was looking at the one
// screen in the product that was not live.
//
// Diffing the rendered view is what stops that becoming a frame per host per
// pass: a host nobody has touched marshals to the same bytes and says nothing,
// and a host that is merely alive says something once per heartbeat rather
// than once per pass. The cost is bounded by how many hosts a fleet has, which
// is tens -- this is deliberately not how the runners are done, because there
// are thousands of those and the same idea would be too expensive.

// The scheduled backup is a backup against a mistake. This is the other half:
// every copy the fleet takes is put in an S3-compatible bucket somebody else's
// disk is responsible for, because a directory of tidy copies on the volume
// that just died is the worst kind of backup -- everyone believed in it.
//
// The pass is written as "make the bucket hold what the directory holds"
// rather than "upload the backup that was just taken", and that is the whole
// design. A remote that was unreachable for two nights is two backups behind;
// a pass that only ever sent the newest would leave the gap there forever and
// nothing would say so. So every pass lists the remote, works out what is
// missing, sends it oldest first, and applies the remote's own retention
// afterwards.

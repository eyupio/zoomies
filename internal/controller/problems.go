//
// An error rather than a warning, and one that never clears by itself: there
// is no state this process can reach on its own that makes it safe again. Two
// controllers over one database mint runner credentials against each other,
// reclaim each other's hosts and reap each other's workloads, and every
// symptom of it looks like a bug somewhere else -- which is the reason to name

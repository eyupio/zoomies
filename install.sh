# Zoomies installer -- off the lead, on the job.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh
#
# It is also perfectly safe to download and read this first, which is the
# recommended way:
#
#   curl -fsSLO https://zoomies.sh/install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. works out your OS, architecture, container runtime, compose command and
#      init system
#   2. downloads the right binary and verifies its SHA-256 against the
#      published checksums file
#   3. installs it to /usr/local/bin
#   4. hands off to `zoomies init`, which does the interactive setup and can
#      deploy Zoomies three ways:
#
#        native   the binary under systemd (or launchd), which is the leanest
#                 option and the one that needs no container runtime at all
#        compose  a docker-compose.yml and a fully populated .env, brought up
#                 with `docker compose up -d`
#        docker   a single `docker run` container with an env file
#
#      Either way `zoomies init` does the rest: service user, directories,
#      encryption key, backend, the GitHub App, and your admin account. It
#      also asks how the controller is reached: loopback, a certificate you
#      have, a self-signed one, or a reverse proxy.
#
#      Behind Cloudflare, pick "Cloudflare in front" (or put
#      `trusted_proxies: [cloudflare]` in the answer file): TLS stays off
#      here, Cloudflare's published ranges are trusted as proxies, and audit
#      entries and rate limits record the real client instead of Cloudflare.
#
# POSIX sh. No bashisms -- it is checked with dash and shellcheck in CI.

Zoomies installer

Usage:
  install.sh [options]

Options:
  --mode <single|controller|agent>
                        What to install. "single" is a controller with an
                        embedded agent -- one process, one VM, the common case.
                        Asked interactively if omitted.
  --deployment <native|compose|docker>
                        How to run it. "native" is the binary under systemd,
                        "compose" writes a docker-compose.yml and a populated
                        .env, "docker" runs a single container. Asked
                        interactively if omitted, and only the ones this host
                        can actually run are offered.
  --controller <url>    For --mode agent: the controller to join.
  --join-token <token>  For --mode agent: a join token from the UI or
                        `zoomies hosts join-token create`.
  --version <v>         Release to install (default: latest).
  --prefix <dir>        Where to put the binary (default: /usr/local/bin).
  --non-interactive     Never prompt. Requires --answers, or enough flags.
  --answers <file>      YAML answer file for unattended setup. Implies
                        --non-interactive and --yes.
  --no-init             Install the binary only; do not run `zoomies init`.
  --yes, -y             Do not ask before installing. Implied by
                        --non-interactive and --answers.
  --allow-unverified    Install even when the download's SHA-256 cannot be
                        checked against the release's checksums.txt. Only for
                        a private mirror that does not publish one.
  --uninstall           Run `zoomies uninstall`, then remove the binary.
  --help, -h            This.

Environment:
  ZOOMIES_VERSION, ZOOMIES_PREFIX, ZOOMIES_REPO, ZOOMIES_BASE_URL
  ZOOMIES_ASSET_WAIT    Seconds to wait for a just-published release's
                        binaries to finish uploading (default 300, 0 to
                        fail immediately).
  NO_COLOR              Disable colour.

Examples:
  # A single VM, interactive
  curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh

  # Add a runner host in one line
  curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- \
      --mode agent --controller https://zoomies.example.com --join-token zoojoin_...

  # Unattended
  sh install.sh --non-interactive --answers /etc/zoomies/answers.yaml

  # Behind Cloudflare, unattended: the same answer file, with the listener
  # told that Cloudflare terminates TLS and may speak for the client:
  #   bind: 0.0.0.0:8080
  #   tls:
  #     mode: "off"
  #   trusted_proxies: [cloudflare]
  # Interactively, `zoomies init` offers "Cloudflare in front" at the
  # reachability question and writes all three for you.

# The interview has to be able to finish
#
# On the documented one-liner as an ordinary user, the binary is installed with
# sudo and setup then runs unprivileged. `zoomies init` quietly retargets
# everything at the operator's home -- ~/.config/zoomies rather than
# /etc/zoomies, the service running as them rather than a dedicated account --
# still offers "the binary under systemd", and fails at the second-to-last step
# with "writing /etc/systemd/system/zoomies.service: permission denied". By
# then the GitHub App and the administrator have been created against a
# configuration directory that a re-run under sudo will not look in.
#
# So the elevation the binary needed is carried through to setup as well, which
# is what the operator expects from a script that has already asked for their
# password.
#
# An agent join is not exempt. It writes the same kind of unit, and it redeems
# its single-use join token before it gets that far, so a join that fails at
# the unit has spent the token and left its credentials under the operator's
# home -- the retry under sudo needs a new token and finds a different state
# directory.

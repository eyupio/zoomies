// The first fault drill: the controller is killed in the middle of a job.
//
// A control plane is allowed to die. A job is not. The runner is a process on
// somebody's machine doing somebody's work, and the only thing that should
// follow from the controller going away is that nothing new gets decided until
// it comes back -- not that the work is torn down, not that the fleet forgets
// it, and not that the agent gives up and has to be re-joined by hand.
//
// Every layer of this is already tested in process: the agent's poll loop
// backs off and retries, the task queue is re-derived from the rows on start,
// and adoption reattaches what is already running. What no in-process test can
// show is the three of them surviving the same event, with a real process
// holding a real job while the thing that decided to start it is not there.

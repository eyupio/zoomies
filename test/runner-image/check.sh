# The build already proves a few tools are on PATH. What it cannot prove is the
# contract the rest of the system assumes about the finished image: the uid the
# Docker backend sets a work mount up for, the files the entrypoint execs, the
# runner release the Dockerfile pinned, and that a variant is the operating
# system its tag and its catalogue row say it is. Any of those going missing
# otherwise shows up as a runner that will not start in somebody's pool, which
# is a worse place to find out than this job.
#
# Every expectation below names where it comes from, so a change to that source
# and a failure here arrive in the same review. <os> and <version> are the
# catalogue row's (internal/naming/images.go), passed straight from the
# generated workflow matrix or the Makefile's variant rows, so nothing here
# repeats the catalogue.
#
# No goss or similar: every assertion is one command inside the image, and a
# shell script is the smallest thing that runs one.

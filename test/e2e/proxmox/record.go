// reading, and it is written to a file of its own rather than into the record:
// the record states the procedure, and a harness that edited it could quietly
// make the procedure describe whatever happened. A person copies these tables
// in, having read them.
//
// The vocabulary is the drill record's -- what was expected, what was observed,
// and the last column, "human action needed", which is the one the record is
// read for. A run that recovers on its own and a run that leaves somebody a VM
// to delete are different findings, and only the row says which.

// phaseOrder is the seven timings the qualification record asks for, in the
// order it asks for them. Written here rather than derived from whatever the
// run happened to measure, so that a phase nobody managed to time is an empty
// row rather than an absent one.

# What install.sh does on a host that already has the binary.
#
# Usage: test/install/install-check.sh [path-to-install.sh]
#
# install.sh was checked by `dash -n` and shellcheck and by nothing else, so
# every question about what it *does* was answered by reading it. That is how
# this shipped: the controller's own join command carries --mode agent,
# --controller and --join-token, and on a host that already had the installed
# version the script exited before any of them were used. The host was never
# joined, and the advice it printed -- add --yes -- re-downloaded the identical
# binary and joined nothing.
#
# Nothing here reaches the network or writes outside its temporary directory: a
# stub `zoomies` on PATH plays the part of an existing installation, --prefix
# keeps the binary in a temporary directory so no elevation is needed, and
# --no-init stops before the handoff, which is the part that would need a real
# controller.

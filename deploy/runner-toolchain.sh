# The toolchain a build typically reaches for, per package family.
#
# What is here is what a workflow assumes without ever saying so. The compilers
# and headers are the ones native extensions link against -- node-gyp, a Python
# wheel with no arm64 build, a Ruby gem -- and every one of them fails at `make`
# with a message about the missing library rather than about this image.
#
# python3 and node are here for the steps that use them without a setup-python
# or setup-node first. The setup actions still install their own versions and
# take precedence on PATH, so the versions here are a floor, not a choice about
# which version a workflow gets.
#
# Deliberately absent: a JDK and the other language runtimes with a good setup-*
# action, which install what the workflow asked for rather than what this image
# guessed, and would be hundreds of megabytes of wrong version.
#
# The two families' lists are not translations of each other, because the
# distributions do not split their packages the same way. They are each the
# shortest list that makes the checks at the end pass. lsb_release is in the apt
# list and not the dnf one for that reason: Fedora retired redhat-lsb-core, and
# /etc/os-release -- which every image here has -- is what replaced it.
#
# A fleet's own extra packages are not installed here but in
# deploy/runner-extra.sh, in a layer of its own, so that adding one does not
# reinstall all of this.

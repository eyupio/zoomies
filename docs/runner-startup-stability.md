# Runner startup under host load

Disabling `scheduler.default_runner_limits` improved startup in the reported
fleet. This points to constrained startup, but no production trace or
before/after load benchmark was available to establish a single root cause.

Two concrete problems compound host pressure: the startup queue released new
creates while a quota-limited DinD daemon was still initialising, and newly
created DinD pairs used the whole host share as their throttle base instead of
the per-container half recorded in labels. Restoring their quotas could double
the CPU reservation. Adoption after restart already used the correct half.

The backend now holds startup admission until a bounded `docker info` health
probe succeeds, tolerating transient failed probes and reporting early
OOM/exit. Failure uses the existing cleanup path. The runner image retains
its readiness check for older agents, host sockets and intervening failures.
No consumed JIT configuration is retried.

The per-container throttle base now matches creation and adoption. A bounded
CPU grace protects registration from an additional pressure reduction. A job
accepted during that grace also retains the normal quota. Neither CPU nor
memory limits are removed or raised.

## Defaults and controls

| Setting | Default | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scheduler.default_runner_limits` | `true`, unchanged | Keep host-share limits for automatic pools. |
| `agent.bootstrap_cpu_grace` | `2m`, new | 0s disables; maximum 10m. Restart each agent after configuring it. |
| `runners.docker_wait` | `3m`, previously 2m | Live for new tasks. 0s selects the 2m compatibility fallback; pool environment overrides accept 1–3600 whole seconds. |
| `scheduler.provision_timeout` | `20m`, unchanged | Includes queue time; increase for large bursts and cold pulls. |

The agent's outer 10m create budget still caps image preparation plus daemon
readiness. Existing stored values and environment overrides remain authoritative.
The controller's startup grace configures its embedded agent; standalone agents
need the setting on their own hosts. See [Configuration](configuration.md).

Automatic pool creation and editing reuse Settings findings. The one-time
button lists fleet-wide changes, requires an administrator, respects environment
pins and read-only settings, and identifies pending restarts. Settings renders
the same warning beside each affected item. Existing host-fit and capacity
warnings still diagnose undersized slots; grace cannot fix insufficient memory.

These sources do not establish that removing CPU limits is a universal fix.
Rollout still needs representative concurrent jobs, cold pulls and registration
timings on the affected hosts.

# Zoomies API surface

This is the authoritative list of endpoints. `internal/api` implements exactly
this, `api/openapi.yaml` describes exactly this, and the UI's generated
TypeScript client is derived from that document. **Nothing is reachable from the
UI that is not reachable from the API**, so if a page needs data, it comes from
a route below.

Conventions:

* Base path `/api/v1`. JSON in, JSON out, UTF-8.
* List endpoints take `limit` (default 50, max 500), `offset`, `sort`, `order`
  (`asc`/`desc`) and return `{ "items": [...], "total": <int>, "limit": <int>,
  "offset": <int> }`.
* Errors return `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "...", "field": "...",
  "detail": "..." } }` with a message written for a human. Codes:
  `bad_request`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`,
  `unprocessable`, `rate_limited`, `internal`.
* Timestamps are RFC 3339 with a `Z` offset. Durations are Go duration strings
  (`"5m"`, `"1h30s"`).
* Mutating requests require `Content-Type: application/json` and, for cookie
  auth, an `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site` check (same-origin unless
  `server.allowed_origins` says otherwise). Bearer-token requests are exempt
  because they are not subject to CSRF.
* `Role` is the minimum role required. `—` means unauthenticated.

## Meta and health

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/healthz` | — | Liveness. Always 200 once the process is serving. |
| GET | `/readyz` | — | Readiness: database reachable, migrations applied. |
| GET | `/api/v1/meta` | — | Version, whether bootstrap is needed, whether OIDC is enabled, feature flags. Safe to call before login — it is what the login page uses to decide what to render. |
| GET | `/metrics` | viewer¹ | Prometheus text format. ¹Unauthenticated when `metrics.public` is true. |
| GET | `/api/openapi.yaml` | — | The spec this document describes. |

## Authentication

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/bootstrap` | — | Create the first admin. **Refuses once any user exists** — that check is the whole security of this route. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | — | `{username, password}` → sets the session cookie, returns the identity. Rate limited per source address. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | viewer | Clears the session. |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/session` | viewer | The current identity: id, name, role, scopes, `must_change_password`. |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/password` | viewer | `{old_password, new_password}` for the caller's own account. Invalidates the caller's other sessions. |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/oidc/start` | — | 302 to the identity provider. |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/oidc/callback` | — | Completes the flow, sets the cookie, 302 to `/`. |

## Overview

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/stats` | viewer | Queued/running counts, live runner counts by state, median and p95 queue wait, per-pool utilisation. `?window=1h`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/samples` | viewer | Fleet samples for the sparklines. `?since=` or `?window=1h`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/problems` | viewer | The problems panel: unhealthy hosts, failed registrations, webhook delivery failures, unmatched queued jobs, and every configuration warning from `config.Validate`. Returns `{ "items": [...], "ok": true }` — `ok` is true and `items` empty when there is nothing wrong. |
| GET | `/api/v1/scaling-events` | viewer | Recent scheduler decisions with their reason strings. `?pool_id=&limit=`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/events` | viewer | **SSE.** All live updates. Honours `Last-Event-ID`. Query `kinds=` and `topic=` narrow it. Sends a `heartbeat` comment every 20s. |

## Installations

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/installations` | viewer | Never includes key material. |
| POST | `/api/v1/installations` | admin | `{app_id, installation_id, target, target_type, api_base_url, private_key, webhook_secret}`. The key is sealed before it touches the database. |
| GET | `/api/v1/installations/{id}` | viewer | |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/installations/{id}` | admin | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/installations/{id}` | admin | Cascades to pools; the response says how many. |
| POST | `/api/v1/installations/{id}/verify` | operator | Probes credentials and permissions. On 403 the message names the missing permission. |
| GET | `/api/v1/installations/{id}/runner-groups` | viewer | Populates the pool wizard. |
| GET | `/api/v1/installations/{id}/rate-limit` | viewer | Remaining GitHub API quota. |
| POST | `/api/v1/installations/manifest` | admin | Builds the GitHub App manifest and returns the URL to POST it to. |
| POST | `/api/v1/installations/manifest/exchange` | admin | Exchanges the manifest `code` for App credentials and creates the installation. |
| GET | `/api/v1/webhook-deliveries` | viewer | Recent deliveries. `?status=rejected`. |
| POST | `/api/v1/webhook-test` | operator | Asks GitHub to redeliver / pings the configured URL and reports whether this controller is reachable, with the specific fix when it is not. |

## Pools

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/pools` | viewer | Includes live per-state runner counts and utilisation. |
| POST | `/api/v1/pools` | operator | Full pool object. Server-side validation mirrors the wizard's. |
| POST | `/api/v1/pools/validate` | operator | Dry run: returns field errors and the dangerous-setting warnings the pool would produce, without creating anything. The wizard's review step calls this. |
| GET | `/api/v1/pools/{id}` | viewer | |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/pools/{id}` | operator | |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/pools/{id}` | operator | `?drain=true` (default) drains runners first; `?force=true` removes them immediately. The response says how many runners were affected. |
| POST | `/api/v1/pools/{id}/enable` | operator | |
| POST | `/api/v1/pools/{id}/disable` | operator | Existing runners drain; no new ones are made. |

## Runners

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/runners` | viewer | Filters: `pool_id`, `host_id`, `state` (repeatable), `q`, `include_removed`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/runners/{id}` | viewer | Includes the current job and the host. |
| GET | `/api/v1/runners/{id}/timeline` | viewer | State transitions with durations, for the detail page. |
| POST | `/api/v1/runners/{id}/drain` | operator | Finish the current job, then exit. Never kills a running job. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/runners/{id}` | operator | `?force=true` kills immediately; without it, behaves as drain-then-remove. Deregisters from GitHub. |
| POST | `/api/v1/runners/bulk` | operator | `{action: "drain"\|"delete", ids: [...], force?: bool}`. Returns per-id results so a partial failure is visible. |
| GET | `/api/v1/runners/{id}/logs` | viewer | **SSE.** Live log tail relayed from the agent. `?tail=&follow=`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/runners/{id}/logs/download` | viewer | `text/plain` snapshot with a `Content-Disposition` filename. |

## Jobs

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs` | viewer | Filters: `repo`, `workflow`, `pool_id`, `runner_id`, `state`, `conclusion`, `label`, `q`, `since`, `until`, `unmatched`. Each item carries `queue_wait` and `duration`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/{id}` | viewer | |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/facets` | viewer | Distinct repos, workflows and conclusions, for the filter menus. |

## Hosts and agents

| DELETE | `/api/v1/hosts/{id}` | admin | Refuses while the host has live runners unless `?force=true`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/join-tokens` | admin | Outstanding and spent join tokens. Never the secret. |
| POST | `/api/v1/join-tokens` | admin | `{ttl, labels, capacity}` → returns the plaintext token **once**, plus the ready-to-paste `zoomies agent join …` command. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/join-tokens/{id}` | admin | Revokes an unused token. |

### Agent routes

Authenticated with the agent's own token, never a user session. An agent may
only touch its own host's runners.

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/agent/join` | Redeems a join token, returns host id + agent token. |
| POST | `/api/v1/agent/heartbeat` | Liveness, backend capabilities, runner observations. |
| GET | `/api/v1/agent/tasks` | Long-poll, up to 25s, returns a `TaskBatch`. |
| POST | `/api/v1/agent/results` | Task outcomes. |
| POST | `/api/v1/agent/report` | Out-of-band runner state reports. |
| POST | `/api/v1/agent/logs/{stream_id}` | Chunked outbound log relay for a UI viewer. |

## Migrations

Moving a repository's workflows from GitHub's runners onto this fleet. The plan
writes nothing; the second call is the only thing in Zoomies that writes to a
repository, and it needs three App permissions the rest of Zoomies does not ask
for: Contents (write), Pull requests (write) and Workflows (write).

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/v1/migrations/plan` | operator | `{installation_id, repos?, mapping?, overrides?}`. Returns the rewrites, the skips and a unified diff per file. With no mapping, proposes one from the pools that exist. |
| POST | `/api/v1/migrations/pull-requests` | operator | `{installation_id, repos, mapping?, overrides?, title?, body?, commit_message?}`. One pull request per repository, each on its own branch. Re-plans from the repository's current contents rather than trusting the client. |

`mapping` is one answer per GitHub-hosted label for every repository. `overrides` are the exceptions to it: each is `{repo, path, job, to}` naming one job in one workflow file, with a `to` of `""` meaning that job stays on GitHub's runners. Either one alone is enough to open a pull request.

## Audit

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/audit` | viewer | Filters: `actor_id`, `action`, `target_kind`, `target_id`, `q`, `since`, `until`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/audit/actions` | viewer | Distinct action names for the filter menu. |

## Users, tokens, settings

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/users` | admin | |
| POST | `/api/v1/users` | admin | `{username, password?, email, display_name, role}`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | admin | |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | admin | Refuses to demote or disable the last enabled admin. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/users/{id}` | admin | Same refusal. |
| POST | `/api/v1/users/{id}/password` | admin | Admin reset; sets `must_change_password`. |
| GET | `/api/v1/tokens` | admin | Metadata only. |
| POST | `/api/v1/tokens` | admin | `{name, role, scopes, expires_in}` → the plaintext **once**. |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/tokens/{id}` | admin | Revokes. |
| GET | `/api/v1/settings` | admin | Effective config with every secret blanked, plus the validator's findings. |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/settings` | admin | The subset that is safe to change at runtime: retention, scheduler tunables, poll interval, log level. Anything requiring a restart is rejected with a message saying so. |

## Webhooks

| Method | Path | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/webhooks/github` | — | HMAC-verified. Body capped at 5 MiB. Acts on `workflow_job` and `ping`; records every delivery either way. Path is configurable via `github.webhook_path`. |

## SSE event kinds

Emitted on `/api/v1/events`; the `event:` field carries the kind and `data:` the
JSON payload.

`runner.created` · `runner.updated` · `runner.deleted` · `pool.created` ·
`pool.updated` · `pool.deleted` · `job.updated` · `host.updated` ·
`host.deleted` · `scaling` · `installation.updated` · `problems.updated` ·
`stats` · `audit` · `webhook.delivery` · `heartbeat`

## CLI mapping

The CLI is a client of this API and nothing more. Every command below is one or
two calls to a route above.

```
zoomies pools list | get | create | edit | delete | enable | disable
zoomies runners list | get | drain | delete | logs
zoomies jobs list | get
zoomies hosts list | cordon | uncordon | delete
zoomies hosts join-token create
zoomies installations list | verify
zoomies audit list | tail
zoomies users list | create | delete
zoomies tokens list | create | revoke
zoomies status                # the Overview, in a terminal
```

`--output json|table|yaml` on every read command. Credentials come from
`ZOOMIES_URL` + `ZOOMIES_TOKEN`, or `~/.config/zoomies/cli.yaml`.

# Zoomies architecture

Zoomies is a self-hosted controller for GitHub Actions self-hosted runners. It
watches for queued jobs, creates a fresh runner for each one, and throws the
runner away when the job finishes.

It is one Go binary. `zoomies controller` runs the control plane; `zoomies agent`
runs the thing that actually starts containers. On a single VM the controller
runs an agent inside itself, so the whole system is one process, one SQLite file
and one systemd unit.

## Why this shape

The project this one is modelled on kept a handful of long-lived runners on one
machine, described by a YAML file, registered by hand with a token that expires
after an hour. That works until it doesn't:

| Problem | What Zoomies does instead |
| --- | --- |
| Runners are long-lived, so job state leaks between workflow runs | Ephemeral by default: one job per runner, then the container is destroyed |
| A personal access token in a dotfile next to each runner | GitHub App credentials, sealed at rest, and Zoomies mints short-lived JIT registrations itself |
| 5-minute polling | `workflow_job` webhooks, with polling only as a fallback |
| One host | A controller plus any number of agents, each connecting outbound |
| Runtime state in dotfiles inside runner directories | One SQLite database that can be queried, backed up and audited |
| No auth, no audit | Local users with argon2id or OIDC, RBAC, scoped API tokens, and an audit row for every mutating action |

## Request and event flow

### A job arrives

1. GitHub POSTs `workflow_job` (action `queued`) to `/webhooks/github`.
2. The controller verifies the HMAC signature, records the delivery, and upserts
   a `jobs` row. Deliveries are at-least-once and can arrive out of order, so
   the upsert refuses to move a job backwards through its lifecycle.
3. The reconcile loop wakes immediately (it also runs on a timer).
4. `internal/scheduler.Decide` is handed a snapshot -- pools, runners, queued
   jobs, hosts, and the tunables -- and returns a `Plan`. It is a pure function:
   no clock reads, no database, no network. That is what makes the scaling
   behaviour testable, and it is where every scaling decision's *reason string*
   comes from.
   `Decide` also places each new runner: a host qualifies only if it offers the
   pool's backend, matches the pool's *platform* (distribution, release and
   architecture) and satisfies its host selector, so an Ubuntu 24.04 arm64 pool
   is never handed a Debian amd64 machine. A pool that names no platform, and a
   host that has not reported one, both constrain nothing.
5. For each `create` action the controller picks the installation, resolves the
   runner image from the pool's own image or its platform, asks GitHub for a JIT
   configuration, writes a `runners` row in `provisioning`, and queues a task for
   the chosen host's agent.
6. The agent long-polls, picks up the task, and starts a container with the JIT
   config in its environment. It reports back: `registering`, then `idle`.
7. GitHub hands the job to the runner. A `workflow_job` `in_progress` webhook
   moves the runner to `busy` and links the job row to the runner row.
8. On `completed`, the ephemeral runner exits by itself. The agent notices,
   reports `removed`, and the controller reaps the row.

Every one of those steps publishes on the event bus, and the UI is watching a
Server-Sent Events stream, so the operator sees it happen without refreshing.

### When webhooks cannot reach you

If `github.poll_fallback` is on (the default), a poller lists queued jobs on an
interval and feeds the same code path. The Overview's problems panel says
plainly when the controller is running on polling alone, because a fleet that
silently stopped receiving webhooks looks exactly like a quiet fleet.

## Components

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/store` | The only place SQL is written. Domain types, embedded migrations, every query. Enforces the runner state machine. |
| `internal/config` | `zoomies.yaml` + `ZOOMIES_*`. Splits findings into errors that stop startup and warnings that name every dangerous setting. |
| `internal/cryptox` | AES-256-GCM for secrets at rest; argon2id for passwords; SHA-256 for bearer tokens. |
| `internal/scheduler` | Pure scaling decisions, label matching and platform fit. No I/O. |
| `internal/naming` | The `zoomies-*` naming grammar for pools, hosts and runners, and the runner image catalogue. No I/O; see [Naming and platforms](naming.md). |
| `internal/machine` | What host this process is running on: distribution, release, and how much machine the cgroup actually allows. |
| `internal/github` | App auth, JIT configs, registration tokens, webhook validation, the fallback poller, and a fake GitHub for tests. |
| `internal/backend` | How a runner becomes a real process: Docker, Podman, bare process. |
| `internal/auth` | Identity, RBAC, sessions, API tokens, join tokens, OIDC, audit. |
| `internal/api` | The REST API, SSE, `/metrics`, and the embedded UI. |
| `internal/controller` | Wiring: the reconcile loop, webhook ingest, the agent task queue, the log relay. |
| `internal/agent` | The runner-executing half and its transport to the controller. |
| `internal/installer` | `zoomies init`, `zoomies uninstall`, the GitHub App manifest flow, service installation. |
| `internal/events` | In-process pub/sub that the SSE endpoint fans out. |

## The runner state machine

```
  provisioning ──▶ registering ──▶ idle ⇄ busy
        │               │            │      │
        │               │            ▼      ▼
        └───────────────┴────────▶ draining ──▶ removed
                        │
                        └────────▶ failed ──▶ removed
```

* **provisioning** -- the row exists, the agent has not started the workload.
* **registering** -- the container is up, the runner has not yet appeared online.
* **idle** -- registered with GitHub, waiting for a job.
* **busy** -- executing a job.
* **draining** -- told to finish and exit. A busy runner in `draining` keeps its
  job; nothing kills a running job.
* **removed** / **failed** -- terminal.

Transitions are validated in `store.TransitionRunner`, not in the caller. An
agent cannot report a nonsensical state and corrupt the fleet's accounting.

## Why the agent connects outbound

The controller never dials an agent. Agents long-poll for tasks and POST
results. This means:

* a host behind NAT or a strict firewall needs no inbound rule;
* adding a host is one command with a short-lived join token;
* the blast radius of a compromised agent is bounded -- it can claim tasks for
  itself, not reach into the controller.

The cost is that log streaming has to be inverted: the UI asks the controller,
the controller queues a `stream_logs` task, and the agent opens an outbound
chunked POST that the controller relays to the browser's SSE connection. For the
embedded agent this is all in-process.

## Storage

SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`, so there is no cgo and the binary stays static.

Access is split deliberately: **one** writer connection behind a mutex, and a
pooled reader in WAL mode. SQLite permits exactly one writer, and funnelling
writes through a single connection is what keeps `database is locked` -- the
usual reason small SQLite services fall over -- out of the codebase.

Migrations are embedded and applied on startup, recorded in a
`schema_migrations` ledger.

## Security posture

The default configuration is the safe one: loopback bind, authentication on,
ephemeral runners, no Docker daemon exposed to jobs, no root.

Every deviation from that is named. `config.Validate` returns `Finding`s with a
severity, a title, why it matters and how to fix it; the same list is printed at
startup and rendered in the UI's problems panel. See [security.md](security.md)
for the threat model and each individual toggle.

## What this is not

* Not a Kubernetes operator. [ARC](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)
  already exists and is the right answer if you have a cluster.
* Not a cloud provisioner. There is no EC2 or GCE backend in v1. The
  `backend.Backend` interface is narrow enough -- create, inspect, log, remove --
  that one could be added without the agent learning anything new.
* Not multi-tenant across unrelated organisations. One Zoomies is one team's
  fleet.

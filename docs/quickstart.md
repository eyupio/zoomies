# Quick start

Five minutes, on a fresh Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora or Alpine host. macOS works too
for running a controller in development.

## 1. Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh
```

The script is POSIX `sh`, and it is written to be read before it is run — which
is the way we would rather you did it:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://zoomies.sh/install.sh
less install.sh
sh install.sh
```

It works out your OS and architecture, your distribution and init system,
whether Docker or Podman is present and whether its socket is actually
reachable, whether that socket is rootless, which `compose` command you have,
whether ports 8080 and 443 are free, and whether Zoomies is already installed —
in which case it upgrades in place and says so. The download is verified against
the release's `checksums.txt`, and a mismatch refuses to install rather than
warning.

Everything it discovered is handed to `zoomies init`, so the interactive setup
never asks a question the script already answered.

## 2. Choose how it runs

`zoomies init` offers only what your host can do:

=== "Native"

    The binary under systemd, with a hardened unit. Leanest, starts fastest,
    and needs no container runtime for the controller itself.

=== "Docker Compose"

    Writes a `docker-compose.yml` and a fully populated `.env`, then brings it
    up. Easiest to upgrade and to move to another host.

=== "Docker"

    A single container. Fewest files, but you manage the run command yourself.

Whichever you choose, the containerised deployments write a **fully populated
`.env`** -- no placeholders to go back and fill in. Every variable carries a
one-line comment saying what it is for, the file is `0600` because it holds your
encryption key, and it is written atomically so an interrupted install never
leaves a half-written file that compose would then read.

Re-running the installer over an existing deployment is an upgrade, not a
reinstall: it **keeps the existing encryption key** (minting a new one would
make every stored secret undecryptable) and backs the old file up beside it.

Then it walks the rest: a dedicated service user and directories, an encryption
key (which it will tell you to back up, and say exactly what is lost without),
the runner backend — preferring a rootless Docker or Podman socket, and
spelling out the consequence of each alternative — the bind address and TLS, and
your first administrator account.

## 3. Connect GitHub

Zoomies creates the GitHub App for you through the manifest flow. It opens your
browser at a pre-filled form — and always prints the URL as well, so a headless
host still works — with exactly the permissions it needs and no more:

| Permission | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `organization_self_hosted_runners: write` | register and remove runners (org targets) |
| `administration: write` | the same, for a repository target |
| `actions: read` | read workflow runs and jobs for the fallback poller |
| `metadata: read` | required by GitHub for any App |
| `workflow_job` event | the webhook that makes scaling instant |

Create the App, install it on your organisation, and the credentials come back
to the installer automatically. The private key is sealed with your instance
encryption key before it touches the database, and is never returned by the API.

## 4. Make a pool

A pool says what its runners are, what labels they answer to, and how many may
exist. The installer prints a suggestion named for the host it just set up.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | `zoomies-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` — 4 vCPU each, on Ubuntu 24.04 |
| **Labels** | `zoomies-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` — what your workflows put in `runs-on` |
| **Platform** | Ubuntu 24.04, amd64 — picks the runner image, and keeps these runners off hosts that are something else |
| **Backend** | Docker (rootless if available) |
| **Min / max** | `0` / `8` — nothing idle when nothing is queued |
| **Idle timeout** | `5m` |
| **Ephemeral** | yes |
| **Docker in jobs** | none |

Always set a maximum. It is your only backstop against a runaway workflow.

The name is a convention rather than a rule — any name works — but one that
says how much machine a workflow is asking for is worth far more in a `runs-on`
than `linux-x64` is. See [Naming and platforms](naming.md).

## 5. Run something

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, zoomies-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: make test
```

Push it. Zoomies sees the `workflow_job` webhook, starts a runner, and you watch
the whole thing happen on the Overview page without refreshing — including the
scheduler's reasoning, in its own words:

```
scaled zoomies-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404 0 -> 1: 1 job queued > 30s
```

## Adding another host

Generate a join token in the UI under **Hosts → Add a host**, or on the CLI, and
run the one line it gives you on the new machine:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- \
  --mode agent \
  --controller https://zoomies.example.com \
  --join-token zoojoin_...
```

Join tokens are single-use and short-lived. The agent connects outbound only, so
the new host needs no inbound firewall rule.

## Unattended installs

Every prompt has a flag, and there is an answer file for the rest:

```sh
sh install.sh --non-interactive --answers zoomies-answers.yaml
```

`zoomies init --print-answers` writes a commented template. In non-interactive
mode a missing required answer is an error naming the key and what it is for,
never a silent default.

## If something is wrong

```sh
zoomies status          # the Overview, in a terminal
zoomies config check    # validate the config without starting anything
journalctl -u zoomies -n 50
```

The Overview's problems panel, `GET /api/v1/problems` and `zoomies status` all
render the same list, each entry with what is true, why it matters and what to
change. When there is nothing wrong it is one quiet line.

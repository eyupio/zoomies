# Eli, the assistant

Eli is the assistant built into Zoomies. The name stands for **Extremely Lively
Intelligence**, which is what a dog is for a few minutes after a bath, and what a
fleet is meant to be. Eli is a chat in the corner of every page. You ask in plain
words, and Eli answers about Zoomies, about GitHub Actions and, if you allow it,
about your own fleet.

Eli talks to a model **you** choose and pay for: one on your own machine such as
Ollama, or a hosted one such as Ollama Cloud, OpenCode Zen, OpenCode Go, Anthropic or OpenAI, or your own
Claude, ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot plan.
Chat sends nothing until somebody asks Eli something. Enabled automatic repair policies also send PR source and failed-job evidence when a job fails.

## Setting it up

Under **Settings, Eli AI Assistant**, add a provider, choose its model from the list the
provider gives, test it, and make it the default. Eli then appears in the corner of
every page for signed-in users with a personal provider. Press <kbd>E</kbd> from anywhere that is not a box
to type in, or press **Ask Eli**. <kbd>Esc</kbd> puts the panel away.

The Ask Eli button opens setup guidance until you have an enabled personal provider; your default answers, or, with none ticked, the first usable one you own. Installation providers remain separate and do not pay for personal chat.

### Using your own subscription

An administrator can also add their own plan, used through the vendor's own program on the
controller's machine: **Claude** through Claude Code, **ChatGPT** through Codex, or
**GitHub Copilot** through its command line tool. Zoomies runs the program and asks
it the question. You sign in to it once, as the user the controller runs as
(`claude auth login`, `codex login` or `copilot login`); Zoomies never sees the login,
holds no key and has no address to call.

| | Claude Code | Codex | GitHub Copilot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sends the question to | Anthropic | OpenAI | GitHub |
| Tools of its own | Every one off | Read-only sandbox | None pre-approved |
| Model | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, chosen from a list | Left empty, Codex chooses, or named | Left empty, Copilot chooses, or named |
| **Test** spends | Nothing | Nothing | One request of the plan |
| Refuses an API key | Yes | Yes | Not detectable |

Things to know before you add one:

* **It is yours alone.** A plan is one person's, and the vendors' terms do not allow
  it to serve other people, so only the person who added the provider can use it,
  test it, change it or make it the default. Another administrator sees it on the
  list, marked with your name, and can remove it, but cannot use it. For them Eli
  answers through a provider they are allowed to use, if there is one.
* **Read the vendor's terms yourself.** Whether your plan allows this use is your
  decision, and Zoomies cannot check it for you.
* **Eli cannot read the fleet through it.** Eli's own fleet tools are never offered
  to these programs, and the fleet switch is not shown for them. They are run from
  an empty temporary directory with an environment that carries no `ZOOMIES_*`
  setting and no key or token. What you type to Eli does leave this machine, for the
  vendor.
* **Codex and Copilot have tools of their own, and cannot be run without them.**
  Claude Code is run with every one of its tools off, in its safe mode. Codex has no
  such mode: it is run in its read-only sandbox, so it can read files the controller's
  user can read, and it is asked in the prompt not to. Copilot is run with nobody to
  ask and none of its approval options passed, so a tool that needs permission does
  not run. For both, whatever their tools did is ignored: it is not shown and Eli
  does nothing on the strength of it, but ignoring what a tool did is not the same as
  the tool not having done it. Only the person who added the provider can ask it
  anything, and nothing about your fleet is put in the question, so what could lead
  one to read a file is the person's own words.
* **Copilot's question is a command line argument.** Anyone who can list processes on
  the controller's machine can read it while the answer is being made.
* **They follow the programs' releases.** The options Zoomies uses are the
  programs' own. If a release stops accepting one, **Test** says to update the
  program.
* **A plan, not an API key.** For Claude Code and Codex, **Test** refuses a program
  signed in with an API key and says so; use the Anthropic or OpenAI provider for
  that. Copilot cannot be told apart, but its token variables are never passed on.
* **Not while Local models only is on.** The question goes to the vendor.
* **Host installs only.** They need the program installed on the machine the
  controller runs on. The controller image is distroless and has none, so a compose
  or image deployment cannot use them.
* **Two at a time.** At most two of these programs run at once, so a busy
  conversation cannot start a crowd of them.

## What Eli can see

By default, **nothing about your fleet**. Eli is told it cannot see it, and answers
what it knows about Zoomies and GitHub Actions, and asks you to paste anything
else. That is the right setting for a hosted model you have not decided to trust
with job and repository names.

To let Eli look, turn on **Let Eli read this fleet through this provider** in that
provider's settings. It is a switch **per provider**, off for every provider
including those you already have, because what is read is sent to that provider.
For a model on this machine or a private network it stays there; for a hosted one
it leaves your network. Changing the switch is recorded in the audit log.

With it on, Eli can look at what an agent of yours could read through the
[MCP server](ai-context.md): the fleet at a glance, problems, jobs and their
history, runners, pools, hosts and their health, label advice, a runner's log while
the runner exists, [Kennel Club](kennel-club.md) findings, and the machines the
fleet [rents from a provider](proxmox.md): which providers exist, which pools each
will buy for and why one will not, and where each machine got to. That last part is
what lets Eli answer "why is this pool full and not renting?" from the fleet and not
from a guess. A setting only an administrator can read, such as `provider.enabled`,
is not something Eli can see, and it is told to say so. When it looks, the panel
says what it looked at, under the answer.

Eli does not get the tools that change the fleet, and it does not get the ones that
read a repository's source. It reads as the person asking, through the same routes
and the same permissions, so it can see nothing that person could not.

## What is sent

When Eli looks at the fleet, what the tools return is sent to the provider with
your question: runner, host, pool, job, workflow, repository and branch names,
statuses, counts, a provider's address and the addresses of the machines it rented,
and the end of a runner's log if Eli asks for it. A provider's credential is never
part of it: the API reports only that one is configured. A tool's answer
is cut at 16 KiB. The switch is still the main control: turn it on for a provider
only if that provider may be shown this.

### What is hidden first

Before anything goes to a model, Zoomies looks in it for credentials and for email
addresses and replaces what it finds with `[redacted credential]` and
`[redacted email]`. It looks in what a tool returns, in what you type or paste, and
in the facts a page shares when you ask Eli about it, and it does so for every
provider, a model on your own machine included, so that the behaviour does not
depend on which one answers.

What it recognises:

* GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_` and `github_pat_`), OpenAI and
  Anthropic keys (`sk-`), AWS access key ids, Google API keys, Slack tokens, npm
  tokens and JSON Web Tokens;
* private key blocks, a password in the address of a repository
  (`https://user:password@host/...`), and the value of an Authorization or Bearer header;
* the value of a setting whose name says it is a secret (`password`, `secret`,
  `token`, `api_key`, `private_key`, `credential`, in any case and with any prefix or
  suffix), such as `DB_PASSWORD=...` or `"access_token": "..."`. A number, a flag, a
  value GitHub has already masked and a reference such as `${{ secrets.NAME }}` are
  left as they are;
* email addresses, such as the author of a commit. Names, hostnames and IP addresses
  are not hidden, because working out why a runner failed often needs them.

The answer says how many were hidden ("1 credential and 1 email address were hidden
before this went to the model."), and the `assistant.chat` audit row records the
counts, never what was hidden. Only what is new in your latest question is counted:
the earlier turns of the conversation are sent again and are hidden again, but were
counted when you asked them.

This is a set of known shapes and not a guarantee. It cannot recognise a secret that
has no shape, such as a password written in a sentence, a customer's name, or a
secret that a log has split across two lines. Do not paste what you would not send to
the provider, and keep the fleet switch off for a provider that must not see job and
repository names.

Job and branch names, commit messages and log lines are written by whoever can open
a pull request against your repositories. Eli is told that such text is data and
never instructions, and every tool result is marked as the fleet's data. Eli has
no chat tool that changes anything, and chat answers are drawn as text, so the most
a hostile name can do is mislead an answer: check what you act on.

## Limits

* One question may take at most six rounds of looking and twelve tool calls.
* Each round may write at most 8,192 tokens, thinking included. A model that
  reaches that ceiling is stopped by its provider, and Eli says so under the
  answer rather than showing what arrived as the whole of it: a thinking model
  at high effort can spend the ceiling on reasoning and send no words at all.
* A conversation is at most 40 messages, 8 KiB each and 32 KiB in all.
* The conversation lives in your browser and is gone when you reload. The
  controller keeps nothing between questions.
* Every signed-in user can ask through their own API provider; controller subscription tools require an administrator. Every chat is written to the audit log as
  `assistant.chat` with the provider, the model, whether the fleet could be read
  and the tools used, and never with what was said.

## If it is not there

* **No answer.** Add an enabled personal provider in **Settings, Eli AI Assistant**, and tick the one you want as your default when you have several.
* **"Eli cannot see this fleet through ..."** The provider's fleet switch is off.
* **A provider error.** The text says what the provider answered; **Test** on its
  card sends one short prompt and says which part failed. A model that does not
  support tools answers without them, and says it could not look.
* **A private address is refused.** `assistant.allow_private_provider` lets a
  provider live on this machine or your network, and `assistant.local_only` refuses
  any that does not.

The demo model that ships with the demo fleet can be asked about "the fleet": it
reads the fleet and repeats what it found, so the whole loop can be seen with no
account and no key.

## Personal conversations and PR repairs

Eli uses your configured model provider. In Settings, Eli AI Assistant, add a personal
provider, test it and make it your default. Its key is encrypted at rest and
never returned to the browser. Each account has its own providers and default.
Administrators manage installation providers separately. Existing API providers remain installation-owned after an upgrade; existing subscription providers retain their owner.

## A chat that fits your work

Open Ask Eli from any fleet page. Choose Compact, Default, Expanded or Full
screen with one click, move the panel to either side, or drag its resize handle.
The panel remembers its size preset and side in this browser. Minimise it while
working and reopen the same conversation. Conversation text stays in memory and
is cleared on sign-out; it is not saved to browser storage.

Ask Eli actions on host, runner and problem views send the displayed context
and a relevant question. Eli sees this snapshot, and can use read-only fleet tools when enabled for its provider. After an
answer, follow-on prompts use the conversation's topic and skip questions
already asked. Extend `web/src/lib/assistant/prompts.ts` with a narrative topic;
new page integrations pass an `EliContext` to `AskEli.svelte`.

## Hybrid provider ownership

| Request | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| Chat and contextual Ask Eli | Signed-in user's personal provider |
| PR repair requested in Zoomies or a GitHub comment | Requester's personal provider: their default, or the first usable one they own |
| Unattended repair of a failed PR job | Installation provider selected by the repository policy |

There is no fallback from a missing personal provider to an installation key
when authentication is enabled. The authentication-disabled development demo
uses its built-in installation provider because it has no personal accounts.
Provider address restrictions and the Local models only setting apply to both
scopes. Removing a user removes their personal providers. Deleting an
installation provider removes repository policies that reference it.

## Set up PR repairs

1. Add an installation provider under Settings, Eli AI Assistant, Installation providers.
2. Open Repository repair policies. Choose a repository, its GitHub installation
   and provider, then enable repairs. Automatic repairs are a separate opt-in.
3. Set the attempt budget, from 1 to 50 per rolling 24 hours. Explicit and
   automatic attempts share this repository budget. Each personal account also
   has a limit of 10 explicit attempts per rolling 24 hours.
4. Under Link a GitHub account, verify that the person owns the account, choose
   their Zoomies user and a repository where they have write permission, and
   link it. Zoomies resolves and records the numeric GitHub ID. A login rename
   never assigns another person's key to a requester.
5. Each requester confirms **Allow this GitHub account to request repairs using
   my provider** on their own Eli AI Assistant settings page, and has an enabled
   personal provider. Administrators cannot confirm on their behalf.
   Changing a link clears this confirmation.

The GitHub App needs **Contents: write**, **Pull requests: write**,
**Issues: write**, **Actions: read**, **Checks: read** and **Commit statuses: read**
for the relevant repositories. Subscribe to **Issue comment** alongside
**Workflow job**. Existing installations may need to approve new App
permissions. Editing `.github/workflows` also requires the appropriate GitHub
App workflow permission, and a separate opt-in on the Zoomies policy.

On a pull request, a linked maintainer can comment:

```text
/eli fix the failing test
/zoomies fix this PR issue
```

Prefer the slash form. `@eli` and `@zoomies` still work, but an at sign notifies
whichever GitHub user happens to own that name, who is not part of your
repository, and a slash command notifies nobody.

Commands must begin a line outside a quote or code block. Only new comments by
human users trigger a repair. Edited comments, ordinary issues, bots and
unlinked users do not. Both triggers use the existing signed webhook endpoint.
The App's own GitHub handle (for example `@zoomies-eyupio2`, the name GitHub
autocompletes) works too, once Zoomies has learned the App's slug. Recognition
uses the comment text and does not require GitHub mention notification routing.

## What a repair does

The durable queue deduplicates webhook retries and charges attempts at
admission. The worker reads the PR's pinned commit, changed text files, repository
inventory and bounded failed-job evidence. It asks the selected model for a
strict JSON plan, with at most six model turns and eight edits. Source is capped
at 128 KiB, individual files at 32 KiB, and replacement content at 64 KiB.
Recognisable provider/GitHub tokens and private-key headers are redacted before
model use. These filters cannot identify every possible secret, so use a
provider permitted to process your repository and job logs.

Eli does not execute repository code or run local tests. It cannot edit symlinks,
submodules, credential paths or binary files. Workflow files are protected unless
explicitly enabled. Fork PRs, closed PRs and default-branch PRs are refused.
An infrastructure failure may produce a diagnosis rather than a code change.

Before publication, Eli rechecks repository policy, provider availability and
requester access. The commit has the original PR head as its parent, preserves
file modes and uses a non-force branch update. A concurrent push stops publication.
Eli never merges the PR or bypasses branch protection.

When a repair starts, Eli reacts to the comment that asked with 👀, then posts progress as a single comment that it edits in place, with a
heading for each stage (sniffing around, fetched a fix, checks passed, got
stuck), and watches check runs and commit statuses on its commit.
It reports checks passed, checks failed, a newer PR head, or unverified after an
hour without complete results. Reported checks are not a guarantee that every
branch-protection requirement is satisfied. Automatic repair will not start
another attempt on an Eli commit. A maintainer can request another attempt.

Queued work survives restart. A repair interrupted during publication has an
uncertain outcome, so it is marked interrupted and never replayed automatically.
Inspect the PR before asking again. Settings, Eli AI Assistant shows repair history;
ordinary users see their own requests and administrators see the whole history.

Model-generated fixes still need review. The limits constrain cost and the
editing surface; they do not prove a patch correct. Provider errors, quota
exhaustion or unsupported model output stop a repair without trying another
user's credentials.

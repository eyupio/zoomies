title: Upgrading a Zoomies fleet
description: >-
  What an upgrade actually does, what happens to running jobs, how far a
  controller and its agents may drift apart, and why there is no downgrade.
---

# Upgrading

Run the installer with `--upgrade` to update an existing deployment:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- --upgrade
```

It downloads and verifies the new binary, checks the existing deployment before
replacing the binary, then restarts its native service or updates its Compose
or Docker container. The first controller start applies any schema migrations.
It does not run setup again or ask a host to redeem a new join token.

For a **remote agent**, copy the upgrade command from its card on **Hosts**.
That command targets the controller's published version instead of blindly
installing the newest release. A newer agent tells you to upgrade the
controller first. A local or unpublished controller build has no matching
published command. The `dev` channel moves, so it can contain a build newer
than the controller by the time you run the command.

The upgrade keeps configuration, credentials, host identity, data volumes,
ports and runtime options. It refreshes locally cached stock runner images
under their existing tags, including Docker-enabled variants; running runners
keep their current images. It does not retag a pool's pinned or custom image.
A custom **service** image needs an explicit `--image <reference>`.

Container upgrades allow up to twenty minutes for the old service to stop.
This is a ceiling, not an added delay: the agent finishes admitted runner
creation and cleanup, reports the result, then exits. Running CI jobs keep
running in their existing containers; the upgrade does not wait for them to
finish. A cold image pull can therefore make a restart take longer than an
idle upgrade. Remote agents keep sending heartbeats during this wait.

The upgrade command supplies this timeout even for older Compose files;
newly generated Compose files also set `stop_grace_period: 20m` for manual
restarts. Existing native systemd units are preserved during upgrades. If
yours has a shorter `TimeoutStopSec`, use `systemctl edit zoomies` (or
`zoomies-agent` on an agent host) and set `[Service]` / `TimeoutStopSec=1200s`
before upgrading. New systemd installations use that budget by default.

When first upgrading from an older binary, its shorter internal shutdown
limit still applies to that one stop. To avoid interrupting a creation on
that transition, cordon the controller's host in **Hosts**, wait for its
provisioning runners to finish starting, then upgrade and uncordon it.
Existing running jobs can continue throughout.

For a custom installation, pass `--config-dir <directory>` and, where needed,
`--prefix <binary-directory>`. Upgrade uses `deployment.json` for container
installs and the existing systemd or launchd service for native ones. It
refuses an unrecognised deployment instead of guessing at a replacement.

A failed image pull stops before a restart. If a replacement container cannot
start, the upgrade attempts to restore the previous container or Compose image.
That restores the process, **not a migrated database**; the rollback rules
below still apply. An interrupted upgrade can leave `upgrade.lock` in its
configuration directory: remove it only after checking no upgrade is running.

`zoomies upgrade --check` checks the existing deployment without modifying it.
`zoomies update` is its shorter alias and accepts the same flags. Both commands
apply an already installed binary; use the shell command above when the binary
itself also needs downloading.

The parts of that worth knowing before you do it are what happens to work in
flight, how far the pieces may drift apart, and the one direction you cannot
go back in.

## Host usage during a rolling upgrade

Resource-aware allocation adds migration `0028_host_usage.sql` and an optional
heartbeat field. Upgrade the controller first, then the agents, to make their
new measurements available for placement. Older agents can keep running: a
host with no fresh usage reading retains configured capacity and reservation
checks. Local Linux agents begin reporting memory on their first sample and
CPU after a second sample. Unsupported or remote runtime measurements are
shown as unavailable, never as zero usage.

The [pressure rules](hosts-and-pools.md#current-usage-and-automatic-holds) affect
new runner starts and do not clear operator cordons. No new configuration is
required. This remains a schema migration, so the backup and rollback rules
below apply.

## Default allocations and throttling during a rolling upgrade

Migration `0029_host_throttle_and_runner_allocation.sql` adds the throttle
column to hosts and the allocation columns to runners, and the release that
carries it changes what a runner is given. Both halves are **on by upgrade**:
`scheduler.default_runner_limits` and `scheduler.host_throttling` default to
true, and each is a warning when turned off. What that means for a fleet, in
the order it will be noticed:

* **A pool that sets no `cpus` or `memory_mb` no longer gets unlimited
  containers.** Its runners are created with one slot's share of their host's
  allocatable CPU and memory as a real cgroup limit — the same share the
  scheduler was already charging them. A job that used to have the whole
  machine to itself on a quiet host now has its share of it, and a job that
  needed more memory than its share is killed for exceeding a limit nobody
  typed. The runner's message says the limit was the host's default share and
  names the two ways out: set `memory_mb` on the pool, or lower the host's
  capacity so each runner's share is larger. `host.overprovisioned` says
  before any job does when a host's capacity gives each runner less than a
  core or under 2 GB. [Default
  allocations](hosts-and-pools.md#default-allocations) has the rules.
* **The host's CPU reserve now has a floor** of half a core, or a twentieth of
  the machine on a large one, held back for the daemon. A fleet whose explicit
  pool CPU limits summed to exactly the host's CPUs — four pools of 2 CPU on
  an 8-CPU box, say — takes **one runner fewer per host** than it did, because
  the last one no longer fits; pools with no limits simply get a slightly
  smaller share. A host's `allocatable_cpus` in the API and its committed CPU
  bar on the card show the figure the floor leaves. An operator's own
  `reserve_cpus` replaces the floor where it is larger.
* **Runners created before the upgrade keep whatever limit their pool set** —
  none where it set none — but carry no recorded allocation and an empty
  `allocation_source`: the allocation is written when a runner is made, and
  nothing is applied to a live container retroactively. Two things follow
  while such a runner is on a host. It is counted among the host's
  `unlimited_runners` whatever its pool's limit, so a sustained CPU hold there
  can still throttle the host; and the throttle cannot slow it, because the
  agent lowers only a quota whose allocation was recorded with the container,
  so its job runs at full speed and only the host's smaller effective capacity
  applies. Both end when its pool's next runner replaces it, which for an
  ephemeral runner is after one job.
* **Upgrade the agents before expecting either half.** The controller gives a
  default only where the host's daemon has said it can apply the limit, and an
  agent from before the probe has not said, so its hosts get no defaults and
  `host.limits_unverified` names them until the agent is upgraded. Throttling
  needs the agent's measurements — including the load average, which older
  agents do not send — and needs the agent to understand the throttle
  directive in the heartbeat response; an older agent ignores it, its running
  jobs are never slowed, and only the smaller effective capacity applies.
  Everything else about an older agent holds as before: a host with no fresh
  usage is placed by its configured capacity, and a throttle whose host stops
  measuring is lifted after ten minutes rather than left standing.

To turn either half off: `scheduler.default_runner_limits: false`
(`ZOOMIES_DEFAULT_RUNNER_LIMITS=false`) restores unlimited containers for pools
that set no limits, and `scheduler.host_throttling: false`
(`ZOOMIES_HOST_THROTTLING=false`) stops the controller stepping hosts down and
lifts any throttle already standing. Each is warned about at startup and in the
problems drawer for as long as it stands, because both are the thing that keeps
a host's Docker daemon answering. The CPU floor has no switch; a fleet that
wants every core placed has a smaller reserve than the daemon needs.

## A docker-in-docker slot is one runner again

A `dind` pool runs two containers per runner: the runner, and the daemon its
builds run inside. A pool that **types** its own CPU and memory has both given
those figures — the build would gain nothing from a limit on the container that
is not building — so the host is charged twice, as it has been since the
release that started charging for the pair at all.

What changes here is the pool that leaves its size to the host. Its runner and
its daemon now **split one slot** between them, and the host is charged one. So
a host set to eight slots carries eight runners of such a pool, the same as any
other, where the last release made it four — and an operator who followed the
`pool.host_overcommitted` advice to "adjust the host to the slots its machine
can back" was walked down to fewer slots each time they took it, arriving at
one slot, which held nothing: one slot is the whole machine's share, doubled is
the whole machine again, and a machine always measures a little less free than
it is allocatable.

For such a pool that means **twice as many runners per host** as the last
release, each with half the machine it had: the pair divides the slot rather
than taking two. Nothing changes for a pool that is not `dind`, nothing changes
for one that typed its own figures, and no job is failed by it. A slot too
small to give both halves what a runner needs — under half a core, or under a
gigabyte, after the reserve — is refused with a sentence naming the capacity
that divides it, rather than divided into a runner and a daemon with no limit.
`host.overprovisioned` now counts a slot as a pair only for pools that typed
their limits.

## The usage ledger

Migrations `0047_runner_sessions.sql` and `0048_usage_daily.sql` add two
tables and change none. The first records a session for every runner already
cleaned up when the upgrade runs, reading the runners table without rewriting
it, so the usage report's runner history begins at the oldest runner row the
database still had — about a week back with the default `retention.runners` —
rather than at the upgrade. Runners pruned by an earlier build are gone, and no
migration can bring their hours back; `history_from.runners` on `/usage` says
where the ledger begins.

From then on every runner gets one session when its cleanup is confirmed, or
when the prune takes a row whose cleanup never was, and the prune pass rolls
whole UTC days into `usage_daily` before anything they were computed from can
go. `retention.runner_sessions` keeps sessions for a year by default and never
deletes one the roll-up has not absorbed; the roll-up itself is not pruned. No
configuration is required. The new migrations mean the backup and rollback
rules below apply.

## What happens to work in flight

A restart does not touch a running job. The runner is a container on its host,
the job is executing inside it, and neither is talking to the controller while
that happens — GitHub is. That holds on a host with its own agent, and it now
holds on a single-VM install too, where the agent runs inside the controller:
an agent lists what is already on its host before it starts its loops and
adopts every runner it finds, so a restart finds its own work rather than a set
of containers nobody claims.

It is the controller that says what may be cleaned up. An agent reports the
runners it adopted, and the controller answers with the ones it has no record
of — a runner deleted while the agent was down, say. Only those are removed.
The agent never decides on its own that something is litter, because it cannot
tell "the controller deleted this" from "I have forgotten it", and only one of
those should cost somebody a job.

What a restart interrupts is the *reporting*: webhook deliveries during the gap
are missed, and the fallback poller catches up when the controller returns,
which is one of the reasons to leave it on.

The task queue does not survive a restart either, and that is deliberate: every
task is derived from state the database already holds, so persisting it would
add a second source of truth that could disagree with the runners table. An
agent that finishes work across the gap reports a result for a task the new
controller never issued, and it is applied anyway — the agent did the work, and
the row is the only place that fact can land. Each runner row also records when
its task was last handed to its host, so a restart does not lose how long the
host has actually had it.

One thing a late result cannot do is bring a runner back. If the host was quiet
long enough to be given up on, the fleet has already told an operator, and the
job's timeline, that the runner was gone; a success arriving afterwards does not
make that untrue. Instead the runner keeps its terminal row and the *workload*
is settled: while a job is still running on it the container is left alone to
finish, and once nothing is, it is removed. The job's timeline gains a **runner
returned** entry, so a job that completes normally after its runner was written
off does not read as a contradiction.

Agents keep working while the controller is down. They long-poll, so a
connection that fails is retried with backoff, and a host that cannot reach the
controller does not stop the runner it already started.

Two consequences follow:

* **Upgrade whenever you like.** There is no drain-first ritual. A fleet with
  fifty jobs running is as safe to upgrade as an idle one.
* **A host that stays silent past `store.HeartbeatTimeout` — ninety seconds —
  is counted unhealthy.** A controller that is down for longer than that will
  show every host as unhealthy for a moment when it comes back, until the next
  heartbeat arrives. That is the display catching up, not a fault.

## Version skew

The controller and its agents are separate binaries on separate machines, and
they do not have to match.

The policy, in three rules:

* **The protocol version must match.** It is checked when an agent joins — a
  mismatch is refused there, because an agent that cannot join has nothing
  running to strand — and on **every heartbeat** after that, because an agent
  that joined before a bump would otherwise keep polling and receiving tasks it
  could not understand.
* **An agent may lag the controller by releases**, as long as the protocol
  matches. This is the normal state during a rolling upgrade. The Hosts page
  shows what each host is running.
* **A newer agent against an older controller is unsupported.** It usually
  works, because the controller's API is additive, but it is not a direction
  anyone tests. Upgrade the controller first: it owns the schema and the API,
  and an agent has nothing to migrate.

### What happens when the protocol stops matching

The host is **excluded from placement, exactly as a cordon excludes it** — and
nothing else. Its runners keep working, its agent keeps draining and stopping
them, and the fleet shrinks host by host as it goes.

It is deliberately not a refusal. Answering a heartbeat with an error would
send every agent in the fleet into its re-join path at the same moment, which
is the outage the upgrade was meant to avoid.

The host says `incompatible` on the Hosts page with both protocol versions, a
pool that can no longer place says "running an agent this controller cannot
talk to" with the fix, and the agent logs an error about itself on every
change. Upgrading that agent clears it on the next heartbeat, with no re-join.

An agent old enough not to report a protocol version at all is **not** judged.
It is the one case the controller cannot decide, and guessing would empty a
fleet the moment its controller learnt to ask.

### A task kind an agent does not know

An agent handed a task kind it does not understand reports that task as failed,
with a message saying to upgrade it. The controller treats an unrecognised kind
as **not** lifecycle work, so the runner the task concerned is left alone — a
runner that is running a job is not made to fail by a message neither side can
name. Only `create_runner`, `stop_runner` and `remove_runner` are lifecycle,
and that list is an allowlist so a kind added in a later release is safe on an
older controller by default.

### Two agents as one host

Copying a VM, or a state directory, to a second machine gives two agents one
host identity. Both hold a valid token, both report real work, and each sees
only half of that host's tasks — which looks like a fault almost anywhere else.

Zoomies notices. An agent takes a fresh session each time it starts and never
returns to an old one, so a session a host has already moved on from can only
be a second agent still running, and `host.duplicate_agent` says so. Neither
session is refused: both are executing real jobs, and picking one would end the
other's. Stop the agent on the machine that should not be there and re-join it
with its own join token; the problem clears itself an hour after the sessions
stop swapping.

## The platform role, and what your administrators keep

This release adds a fourth role, `platform`, above `admin`, for whoever runs
the process rather than the fleet. Two things move behind it: lifting the
recovery fence, and taking, downloading and restoring backups. A backup is
the whole database — every account's password hash and every sealed
credential, under the key this host holds — so it belongs to whoever operates
the instance.

**Nobody loses anything on the way through.** Every account that held `admin`
comes up holding `platform`, and so does every API token minted at `admin`
that has not been revoked. That is the same authority as before and not one
action more: `platform` is `admin` plus the two things above. A nightly
`zoomies backup` running on an administrator's token keeps working.

What is carried across is what held `admin` *before* the role existed. If you
track `main` and have already started a build that added the role, an account
or token you have made at `admin` since then stays `admin` — you made it
knowing what `admin` no longer reaches, and an upgrade should not overrule
that. Upgrading from a release, the two steps run seconds apart on the same
start, so this excludes nothing you have.

You do not have to do anything. On an instance one team runs, the change is
invisible: everyone who could take a backup yesterday can take one today, and
the Backups page looks the same.

The role earns its keep on the other shape — an instance one team operates
while another uses the fleet. There you separate the two deliberately, by
giving the fleet's people `admin` and keeping `platform` for whoever runs the
process. An upgrade will not do that to you on its own.

The last enabled `platform` account cannot be demoted, disabled or deleted,
for the same reason the last administrator could not be: an instance nobody
can operate is one only a shell can rescue.

## Schema migrations

Migrations are embedded in the binary, run on first start, and recorded in a
ledger keyed by file name. Two rules the code enforces and a test holds:

* A shipped migration's file name never changes. Renaming one re-applies its
  DDL to every existing database.
* A new migration takes the next unused numeric prefix, alone.

They run in one transaction each, in lexical order, and a failure stops startup
with the name of the file that failed. Nothing is applied twice.

Two migrations change rows rather than shape. `0010_docker_pools_get_a_client`
moves a pool whose `docker_mode` is not `none` from the stock runner image
under a moving tag (`latest`, `main`, or none) to
`ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner-docker` under the same tag, because the stock
image has no client for the daemon that mode gives it; the API makes the same
change to every pool saved from then on. A pool pinned to a `sha-<commit>` tag is not
touched, and neither is a pool on a digest or on an image of its own. What the
migration left behind, the controller resolves as it makes a runner: every tag
the running build publishes — the channels and the operating-system aliases,
`vX.Y.Z` among them — is swapped there, and a pool on a reference that cannot be
swapped raises `pool.docker_client_missing` rather than failing its jobs one at
a time. Idle runners made from the old
image are drained and replaced on the first scheduler pass. See [Jobs that
build container images](configuration.md#jobs-that-build-container-images).

`0012_job_installation` is the other. It records on every unfinished job which
GitHub App installation covers its repository, matching an installation on the
repository itself before one on the organisation that owns it, and it then
unclaims any waiting or queued job whose pool turns out to belong to a
different installation. Before it, a job carried no installation identity at
all and a pool was chosen for it on labels alone, so on a controller with more
than one installation a job could be — and deterministically was — matched to a
pool in the wrong GitHub target. Those matches are the ones it takes back: the
pool would never have run the job, and the next scheduler pass decides again.
A job in a repository no installation here covers keeps no installation and is
unclaimed for that reason, which the Jobs page and the problems drawer both
say. Jobs that have already finished are not touched, and neither is a job
already in progress: its runner exists, and where it ran is a fact worth more
than a tidy row. **A controller with one installation sees no change**, because
every pool on it belongs to that installation.

## There is no downgrade

**Migrations are one-way.** There are no down migrations, and there is no
command that removes one.

An older binary started against a newer database **refuses to start**, and says
which migrations it does not have. That check arrived after `0.2-beta`, so
rolling back *to* `0.2-beta` itself is the one case where nothing stops you:
that release will come up on a migrated database and look perfectly healthy.
Put the pre-upgrade copy back alongside the binary, which is what the rest of
this section is about. SQLite itself does not object — it has no
opinion about columns nobody reads — which is exactly why the check exists:
without it, the older binary comes up, looks healthy, reads columns whose
meaning it does not know and writes rows the newer one will not accept, and
does all of it silently. Rolling a release back is a thing people do under
pressure, and this is the moment to be told that the database went forward
with it.

So the rollback plan is a copy of the database from before the upgrade — and
**the controller takes one for you**. Whenever it starts and finds migrations
pending on an existing database, it copies the database to
`pre-migration/zoomies-<timestamp>/` beside it before applying anything, and
keeps the last two. It is the same layout `zoomies restore` takes, so putting
one back is one command.

Take your own as well before an upgrade you are unsure about: the automatic one
is beside the database, and a disk that fails takes both.
[Backup and restore](backup-and-restore.md) is the subject.

## Which image tag to run

Four images are published, and the tag says where the build came from rather
than only how new it is.

| Tag | Means | Moves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:latest` | the newest full release | when a release is published |
| `v1.2.3` | that release, and only that | never |
| `:dev` | the newest commit on `main` | on every merge |
| `:main` | the same as `:dev` | on every merge |
| `:sha-abc1234` | one commit | never |

```text
ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies                 the controller
ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-agent           an agent, for a host that runs one in a container
ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner          the runners a pool starts
ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner-docker   the same, with a Docker client
```

`:latest` on every image means the newest **full release**. It used
to mean the newest commit on `main`, which cost more than a name: both the merge
and the release wrote it, so whichever ran last won, and an operator who pulled
it could get an unreleased build stamped `main-sha-abc1234`. CI now keeps a
rolling `dev` prerelease asset beside the `:dev` images, so the Add Host command
can install the same channel as a controller tracking `main`. Run `:dev` when
you want `main`; it says so.

A prerelease — a tag with a hyphen in it, `v0.1-alpha`, `v1.0-rc1` — is
published under its own tag and does **not** move `:latest`. Name it to run it.

Runner images use the same split. Their default `:dev` follows `main`, while
`:latest` follows the newest full release. Per-platform development tags use
the explicit form `ubuntu-2404-dev`; release builds use
`ubuntu-2404-v1.2.3`. Pin either form on a pool when it must not cross channels.

## What a release carries

Every published binary and the controller image carry a **build-provenance
attestation**: a signed statement that these bytes were built by this
repository's release workflow, from this commit. `install.sh` already checks
the checksum, which says the bytes match what the release names; provenance
says where they came from.

```sh
gh attestation verify zoomies_linux_amd64 --repo eyupio/zoomies
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies:v1.2.3 --repo eyupio/zoomies
```

The attestation is attached twice. `zoomies-provenance.sigstore.json` is the
Sigstore bundle `gh attestation verify` reads — the signed statement together
with the certificate and transparency-log entry that say who signed it.
`zoomies-provenance.intoto.jsonl` is the same signed statement on its own, in
the DSSE envelope that SLSA tooling and the OpenSSF Scorecard recognise as
provenance. Both describe every binary in the release; neither is needed to
install, and `install.sh` checks neither.

Every image says what it is without being started, in the standard OCI labels —
`org.opencontainers.image.version`, `.revision` and `.created`. That includes
the runner images, which until recently carried no version at all.

A tag with a hyphen in it — `v0.1-alpha`, `v1.0-rc1` — is published as a
**prerelease**. GitHub keeps prereleases out of `/releases/latest`, so while
every release so far is one, `install.sh` with no `--version` asks the API for
the newest release of any kind instead. Once there is a full release, that is
what "latest" means and prereleases stop being offered. Either way, name the
tag with `--version v1.2.3` when it matters which one you get.

A published full release cannot be rebuilt: the release workflow refuses.
A published prerelease can, because it is still explicitly not finished. A
released tag is a promise about specific bytes, and replacing them behind
people who have already downloaded them is not an upgrade anyone can reason
about.

## Upgrading an agent host

A controller upgrade is one machine. A fleet is not: each agent host runs jobs
that belong to somebody, and the sequence below is the difference between an
upgrade nobody notices and a wave of failed builds.

```sh
# 1. Stop new work arriving, and let what is here finish.
zoomies hosts drain hst_k3f9qz2m

# 2. Wait for it to empty. Each runner gets five minutes to finish what it is
#    on, so this takes about that, not as long as the longest job.
zoomies hosts list

# 3. Swap the binary and restart the unit.
curl -fsSL https://zoomies.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- --no-init
sudo systemctl restart zoomies-agent

# 4. Let it take work again.
zoomies hosts uncordon hst_k3f9qz2m
```

`hosts drain` cordons before it drains, and the order is the whole point:
draining a host that still accepts work means the scheduler puts a fresh runner
on it while the old ones are finishing, and the count goes down and back up
while an operator watches and concludes the drain failed.

Step 2 is optional, and skipping it is safe rather than merely tolerated: an
agent that restarts over running work adopts it rather than reaping it, which is
what makes a binary swap non-disruptive at all. Draining first is what makes it
*predictable* — a host with nothing on it cannot surprise you — and on a host
whose jobs are short it costs a few minutes.

On a Windows host the same sequence is `zoomies hosts drain`, replace
`zoomies.exe` in place, then `sc.exe stop zoomies-agent` and
`sc.exe start zoomies-agent` from an elevated prompt, and `zoomies hosts
uncordon`. A Windows agent runs the `process` backend, so the runner release it
downloads is pinned by the pool's `runner_version` and the digests in the
binary, and an agent behind the controller's release may not know a digest the
controller's default asks for; upgrade the agent first on that platform.

An agent that comes back on a release the controller does not recognise is
excluded rather than refused: it keeps heartbeating, its running work finishes,
and no new runner is placed on it. The Hosts page says so on the card. See
[What happens when the protocol stops matching](#what-happens-when-the-protocol-stops-matching).

## Upgrading a container deployment

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The database lives in a named volume rather than in the container, so replacing
the container keeps it. `docker compose down` is safe; `down -v` deletes the
volume with the database in it, which is the one command on this page that
cannot be undone.

## After an upgrade

`zoomies version` says what is running, and `zoomies status` says whether the
fleet is happy with it. If a setting was removed or renamed in the release, the
validator says so by name at startup rather than ignoring it: an unknown key in
`zoomies.yaml` is refused, so a setting that silently does nothing is not a
state this can get into.

## RC1 runner timing and restart reporting

An agent restarted over a process runner may not know its eventual exit code,
because the process belonged to the old agent. That outcome is now explicit:
the runner is removed with an unknown-exit message, while GitHub remains the
source of the job result. An exit code the agent did record still distinguishes
a clean exit from a failure.

The RC1 migrations retain older cleanup timestamps as estimates. Confirmed
cleanup needs both host and GitHub observations, so an older row may show
“Awaiting confirmation” alongside its earlier estimate. Upgrade the agents as
well as the controller to receive autonomous host-cleanup confirmations.

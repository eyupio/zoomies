# The UI

Twelve pages, one job each. Everything on them is live — every page updates in
place from the controller's event stream, so you never have to press refresh,
though the same button sits at the top of each one for when you want to be sure
— and nothing is reachable from the UI that is not reachable from the
[REST API](api-surface.md). Light and dark follow your system until you
choose one, and the screenshots below follow this site's.

The fleet in them is the demo fixture the Playwright suite runs against: two
pools, three hosts, a dozen runners across every state the controller knows,
and a morning's worth of jobs. `ZOOMIES_SEED_DEMO=true` writes the same fleet
into an empty controller, so you can walk through these pages yourself before
connecting GitHub.

## Overview

The page that has to earn the second monitor. It opens on the activity
matrix, showing today by the hour: a row of twenty-four squares coloured by
what finished, greener as more jobs finish and red the moment any fail. Widen
it to the year and the same band becomes the fleet's days laid out the way a
contribution graph is — a column per week, a row per weekday, the month named
above the week it begins in. Hover a square and it says everything
it holds: how many jobs were queued, started and finished, how they ended,
the runner time they used and the pool-minutes spent at capacity. Select one
and the day opens under the grid, hour by hour, with links to that day's jobs
and its usage report. A select recolours the same squares by queued jobs,
runner time or how often a pool was blocked on capacity, so a queue that
backs up every Monday is a shape rather than a table, and the quick ranges
— 1d, 7d, 30d, 90d, 1y — cut the window: today and the last week are drawn by
the hour, a row of twenty-four squares per day, which is the punch card that
shows when the fleet is busy. It opens on today, and the range you choose
instead is remembered. The band is
cut to the width of the screen and the grid is one tab stop: the arrow keys
walk it, Enter selects.

Under it, four numbers with an hour of shape behind them — queued jobs,
running jobs, live runners, and the median queue wait with its p95 — then how
long runners take to start and to register. Then each pool's busy runners
against its live ones with the floor and ceiling marked, what is running this
moment, and a feed of what has happened to the fleet lately: the scheduler's
decisions in its own words — *scaled zoomies-demo-linux-x64 4 → 5: 1 job
queued* — beside how each job ended and the step it stopped at, a runner
that failed and a runner that came up ready for work, a runner lent spare CPU
— *Squirrel spotted — maximum zoomies* — or slowed because its host is under
pressure, a host that went quiet, a machine a provider is renting and a pool
somebody changed. What went right is in it as much as what went wrong. Which of those it carries is yours to choose, one switch per
kind on **Settings → Events**, and the panel counts what it is showing rather
than quietly leaving the rest out. When
something needs a person it is one line and a *Review* button, never a list
that pushes the fleet below the fold. The
*Other runners* switch says whether these numbers count only the jobs this
fleet ran or every job GitHub reported on an installed repository — the
default is this fleet's own work, because that is the question an operator is
usually asking.

## The problems drawer

Reachable from the count in the top bar on every page. Cordoned or silent
hosts, failed registrations, a queued job no pool will run, a job whose runner
stopped under it, a provider that could not be reached or a machine that never
became a host, and every configuration setting that weakens the default
posture — worst first, each saying what is true, why it matters and what to
change, with a link to the page where you change it: the provider, the machine,
the pool or the runner it is about, each of which has one.

## The command palette

`Ctrl+K` (`⌘K` on a Mac) jumps to any page, pool, runner or host by name, and
runs the quick actions — drain a runner, cordon a host, create a
pool — without leaving the keyboard.

## Pools

What runners to make. Each pool's labels, GitHub target, backend, floor and
ceiling, idle timeout, whether its runners are ephemeral and whether jobs get a
Docker daemon — and a risk badge on any pool that trades some of the default
safety away, so the trade is visible from the list.

![The Pools page: queue pressure and configured headroom above each pool's runner and configuration details](screenshots/pools-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

A pool's own page shows its runners and recent jobs, the exact `runs-on:` line
a workflow writes to land here, and its configuration with the warnings — if
any — that the settings earn it.

## Runners

Every runner that exists right now and what each one is doing. Removed runners
are hidden by default, because a busy fleet makes and destroys thousands of
them and they are all history. Rows select for bulk drain or delete, and the
state filter is a real filter: it narrows the set rather than repainting it.
Above the grid, the runner lifecycle is the controller's own state machine
drawn out — provisioning, registering, idle, busy, draining — with how many
runners are at each step this moment and a link into each; under it, a bar of
the same states whose segments are links too, and say their share when you
hover them.

![The Runners page: job queue depth, runner state totals, provisioning demand and lifecycle composition above the runner grid](screenshots/runners-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot }
![The Runners page: job queue depth, runner state totals, provisioning demand and lifecycle composition above the runner grid](screenshots/runners-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

A runner's page carries the job it is on, a timeline of how long it spent in
each state — provisioning, registering, idle, busy — its resource usage as the
host's agent last reported it, and the live log. Beside the usage is the
**allocation**: the CPU and memory the runner was created with, and whether the
pool set them or the host gave it its default share of the machine. The source
is the thing to read when a runner was killed for exceeding its memory: a limit
from the pool is raised on the pool, and a host's share is raised by lowering
the host's capacity or by giving the pool a `memory_mb` of its own. The page
also says when the runner's host is throttled, because a job running at half
its allocation is slow for a reason the runner itself cannot show.

![A busy runner's page: its current job, a timeline of its states, details and resource usage](screenshots/runner-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

The expandable activity panel shows the queued jobs, running jobs, idle runners
or live runners over the last day, six hours or hour — it opens on the day, and
a wider window folds
the minutes into intervals that carry their peak, so a spike is never averaged
away. Hover the line for every figure at that moment, or inspect it with the
timeline control; gaps indicate missing samples. Fleet context is independent
of grid filters, while selecting a pool scopes the headline runner metrics.

## Queue

Provisioning demand has its own view, with ready, expedited, paused and removed
counts alongside filtering and bulk controls. Job queue depth can remain high
when provisioning demand is held; these are separate measures.

![The Queue page: provisioning demand composition, status filters and bulk controls](screenshots/queue-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot }
![The Queue page: provisioning demand composition, status filters and bulk controls](screenshots/queue-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

## Jobs

Everything this fleet claims, runs or is waiting to run, with each job's queue
wait and duration. Status is the filter this page is opened for, so it is a row
of buttons above the grid — **Running**, **Queued**, **Failed**, **Finished**,
**All** — and the page opens on *Running*, which is the question an operator
arrives with. That default is for a bare visit only: every link into this page
that already carries a filter keeps it, so the problems drawer's unmatched link
and the Overview's outcome links still show what they promised.

The rest of the filters — repository, workflow, pool, label, outcome, dates —
live in the URL alongside it, so a view can be pasted into a chat. A queued job
that no enabled pool claims is one filter away — *Unmatched only* — and the
problems drawer links straight to it: on an organisation that also rents
runners elsewhere, most such jobs are somebody else's rather than a fault.

![The Jobs page: queue depth, running jobs, success rate, P95 wait and outcome composition above the job grid](screenshots/jobs-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

Opening a job says where it went wrong first: the step that failed and how
long it ran, with a link to that step's log on GitHub — or, when the runner
died under it, that the failure is the fleet's and the workflow did nothing
wrong.

## Usage

Runner-hours, jobs and queue waits over a date range — today, until you widen
it — grouped by pool, repository, workflow or installation, with an estimated cost wherever an
administrator has given a pool a rate. Zoomies embeds no cloud prices. The
table exports as CSV.

The range is drawn as a chart with the same hand as the Overview's fleet
activity: a line per figure, chosen by chip — the jobs queued and how they
ended, or executing runner time against the time allocated to hold the runner
— and the moment under the pointer read off every line at once, in the rows
beneath as well as beside the crosshair, so a figure never lives only in a
card that a finger's lift takes away. Where a pool had work and nowhere to put
a runner, the intervals are shaded behind the lines. An interval that has not
happened yet is a gap rather than a zero: a report to the end of today is a
window with hours still in it.

The same activity matrix as the Overview's draws the
chosen range — a square per day laid out as a calendar, or a square per hour
for a range of two days or less — cut to the grouping and the group in
focus, so a repository's bad week is a red row of squares rather than a
column of numbers.

## Hosts

Where runners can go. Each machine's heartbeat, its slots in use, the disk its
runners have left to write into, what the fleet has already committed of its CPU
and memory against what may be placed on it, the backends its agent found — and
the exact command to run when one is missing — and the labels pools select it
by. Slots and the committed bars answer different questions: the first is
whether the fleet will place another runner here, the second whether the machine
can carry it, and a host with free slots and no memory left takes nothing.
Each of the two settings a host has is reached from the thing it describes.
*Adjust*, beside the slot bar, owns the resources: how many runners the host may
hold, and the reserve — the cores, memory and disk the scheduler leaves alone
for the machine's own sake. Each sits on a slider with the recommendation marked
on it, worked out from the machine's size and the largest ask across your enabled
pools, and *Set to recommendations* puts all four back in one press; a setting
past its mark warns rather than refuses. *Edit*, beside the labels, sets the
labels and nothing else. A cordoned host keeps its runners and takes no new
ones. *Add a host* mints a join token and prints the one line to paste on the
new machine.

**Agent connected** describes the heartbeat. Recent **CPU usage**,
**memory available** and the one-minute **load** describe the machine's actual
load, separately from its committed resources. A pressure warning says whether
new starts are held or limited to one at a time; recovery happens automatically
and keeps any manual cordon. A missing or stale reading is shown as unavailable.
See
[current usage and automatic holds](hosts-and-pools.md#current-usage-and-automatic-holds)
for the thresholds and the limits of these measurements.

A host the controller has stepped down after sustained pressure wears a
**Throttled** badge, with the step in its title, and its slots line reads
"*n* of *m* slots in use · throttled from *capacity*": the smaller figure is
what the host is taking right now, and the configured capacity is untouched.
The notice under it is the throttle's own sentence — what was taken, which
measurement did it, what the running jobs are getting, and that it lifts one
step after five minutes of calm — and **Lift the throttle** beside it clears the
throttle by hand once the cause is fixed. The adjust dialog's note about the
floors under a reserve names the CPU floor too: half a core, or a twentieth of
the machine, held back for the daemon whatever the operator sets.

## Providers

Where machines come from. A provider is one place Zoomies may rent a machine —
a hypervisor, today [Proxmox VE](proxmox.md) — and its card leads with what is
being spent: the machines it holds against the ceiling it may not pass, the
shape it builds, and, in the controller's own sentence, why no new machine may
be bought this moment. A new provider starts at a ceiling of zero and rents
nothing, so turning a provider on and saying how much of it you are willing to
pay for are the same act. *Check* runs the preflight against the real provider
— read-only there, audited here — and a provider nobody has ever checked says
so rather than looking healthy. Under the cards is every machine across every
provider, narrowed by a state filter that lives in the URL, so a link to one
part of the lifecycle is a link somebody else can open.

![The Providers page: machines owned against the ceiling that may not be passed, the lifecycle band from planned to draining with the switch that pauses new machines beside it, and the card for the one provider this fleet rents from](screenshots/providers-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot }
![The Providers page: machines owned against the ceiling that may not be passed, the lifecycle band from planned to draining with the switch that pauses new machines beside it, and the card for the one provider this fleet rents from](screenshots/providers-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

Adding one is five steps — where it is and how we sign in, where a machine is
built, what shape it is, what it may spend, and what the controller makes of it
— and none of them creates anything: the draft is sent to the controller for a
verdict as it is typed, so a rejection appears beside the answer that caused it
while there is still a reason to change it. [Adding a Proxmox
provider](proxmox.md#the-provider) walks through the form. The credential is
sealed as it is stored and never comes back, so editing a provider shows an
empty credential box and leaving it empty keeps the stored one.

A provider's own page ends on the orphan review: resources at the provider
wearing this fleet's naming that no machine of ours accounts for, machines that
hold no resource, and machines nothing has confirmed are ours. **Nothing there
deletes anything.** Its one button forgets a row Zoomies holds and leaves the
resource behind it alone, because something we cannot prove is ours may be
somebody's hand-made VM that happens to be named like ours, and destroying that
is the one mistake that cannot be undone. The sweep behind the list is the
expensive part of answering, so it runs when the tab is opened and not before,
and the whole tab needs the administrator role.

A machine's page is written for the ten minutes when something is taking longer
than it should. Its timeline is one row per phase the machine actually reached,
the last row still counting while the machine is on its way, because a clone
that never finished and a guest that cloned and never enrolled are faults in
different systems. While an operation is in flight the page carries the
provider's own handle for it, to paste into the hypervisor's task log and read
the other half of the story, and it keeps the provider's complaint and the
guest's separately, so a success at one does not erase the other's.

![A machine's page: where it is at the provider, which pool's unmet demand asked for it, whether a delete would be safe, and a timeline of the phases it has reached with the last one still counting](screenshots/machine-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot }
![A machine's page: where it is at the provider, which pool's unmet demand asked for it, whether a delete would be safe, and a timeline of the phases it has reached with the last one still counting](screenshots/machine-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

The same lifecycle band sits on the Hosts page, above the hosts these machines
become, because an operator short of hosts is asking whether more are on their
way. The switch beside it stops new machines being bought across every
provider, and it is the only control there on purpose: it survives a restart,
and it holds nothing else back — a drain finishes, a delete completes, and a
machine already being built is still followed to wherever it ends up — so
pressing it during an incident stops the spending without stranding a VM. A
host Zoomies rented says so on its card, and its remove action sends you to
delete the machine instead: removing the host here would leave the machine
running, and on the bill.

There is no way to make a machine by hand, here or anywhere else. A machine
exists because a pool had queued work and nowhere to put it, and a second
source of supply would be a second thing the reconciler would then decide to
delete. An operator who wants more machines raises a ceiling. [What a provider
has to implement](providers.md) is the contract behind all of this.

## Installations

The GitHub App connections: which organisation or repository, the App and
installation IDs, how much of the API rate limit is left, and every webhook
delivery GitHub has made, accepted or rejected — so an empty list beside a
running workflow says the deliveries are not arriving, which is the fault that
otherwise looks like a slow fleet.

## Migrate

The wizard that moves repositories onto the fleet: choose an installation,
tick repositories, map each hosted-runner label to a pool, and review the exact
diff before one pull request per repository is opened. Jobs it will not touch —
a `${{ matrix.os }}` expression, a runner that is already self-hosted — are
listed with the reason, here and in the pull request body. [How it
works](migration.md).

## Audit

Every change made through this controller and who made it — users, API tokens
and the system itself — with the target and the source address. Open an event
to see exactly what changed. Secrets were redacted when the row was written,
so nothing here can leak one.

![The Audit grid: when, actor, action, target and source address for each change](screenshots/audit-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

## Settings

A section of pages rather than a page of tabs, with its own rail beside them:
your account, appearance and which events the Overview's feed shows; the
accounts that can sign in and their roles, and the API tokens; the
configuration this controller is actually running with, its backups, and what
it is. Each page has an address of its own, so a
settings page is a link. Zoomies refuses any change that would leave no
enabled administrator, and the pages that need that role are listed for
everybody, marked rather than hidden.

![Settings: the section's rail beside the Users page, listing one administrator](screenshots/settings-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot }
![Settings: the section's rail beside the Users page, listing one administrator](screenshots/settings-light.webp#only-light){ .zoomies-shot }

### Backups

The one settings page that is a tool rather than a form, because a backup is
the one thing here you find out you needed at the worst possible moment.

The schedule is at the top — where copies go, how often, and how many are kept
— and under it the destinations those copies are sent on to: as many
S3-compatible buckets as you want to name, each added, tested and rotated here
without editing a file or restarting anything. Each says what it holds, when it
last heard from the service, and what it refused with if it refused. A
destination can also be listed and a copy brought back out of it, which is the
path a controller takes when the disk it was backing up is gone.

Then every copy this controller knows about, with what took it and whether it
verifies. From a row you can take one now, verify it, download it plain or
sealed with a passphrase, upload one taken somewhere else, and stage a restore
that the next restart applies.

Naming one is not the same as remembering to press a button afterwards: every
copy the schedule takes is sent on by the same pass that took it, and a bucket
that was unreachable for two nights is caught up with both backups it missed
rather than starting from the newest. What a destination costs — who can read
the archive, and what a plain-HTTP endpoint gives away — is set out in
[Security](security.md#a-backup-remote-with-no-passphrase), and the whole of it
in [Backup and restore](backup-and-restore.md).

## On a phone

Read-only monitoring from a phone is a stated requirement, so it is tested. The
navigation moves to the bottom edge, the tiles stack, and everything still
updates in place.

Every grid stays the table it is on a desktop — one line per runner, scrolling
sideways inside its own frame to the columns that do not fit, never taking the
page with it. If you would rather read a row downwards, the **Cards / Rows**
toggle above each grid gives every value a line of its own, with nothing cut
off; **Settings → Appearance** sets which of the two every grid starts in.

![The Overview: four metric tiles with an hour of sparkline behind each, runner startup and registration times, a one-line problems summary, per-pool utilisation bars and a feed of the fleet's recent events](screenshots/overview-phone-dark.webp#only-dark){ .zoomies-shot .zoomies-phone }

The design system behind all of this — tokens, status colours, components and
the accessibility checklist — is in [UI guidelines](ui-guidelines.md).

Nothing here needs a GitHub App to look at: the [quick start](quickstart.md)
takes about five minutes, and `ZOOMIES_SEED_DEMO=true` fills a fresh controller
with the same fleet these screenshots were taken from.

## Provisioning queue

Open **Queue** to manage the demand that causes Zoomies to create runners. Each
row represents a queued GitHub job's provisioning demand, rather than a runner
that already exists.

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Pause | Stop counting the selected items towards new runner demand. |
| Resume | Restore normal demand and clear Run now priority. Also restores deleted items. |
| Delete from queue | Suppress demand persistently. Use the Deleted view to find and restore it. |
| Run now | Resume and expedite demand within the pool's priority tier, bypassing the scale-up delay. |

All four are buttons on the row itself, one press each, as well as on the bulk
bar for a selection. An action already in force is disabled and says why. On the
keyboard a row's buttons are one stop, with the arrow keys moving along them.

These controls do not cancel GitHub jobs or retract provisioning tasks already
issued to agents. Pool minimums and normal runner lifecycle rules still apply;
existing runners may pick up a GitHub job whose provisioning demand is paused.
Run now respects disabled pools, host capacity, runner maximums, repository
limits, failure backoff and recovery fencing.

Filter by repository, workflow, pool, all required labels, exact branch, queued
dates, unmatched work and provisioning status. Multiple values within repository,
workflow, pool or status filters match any selected value; different filters
combine. Labels must all match. The four status cards retain the other filters
and show their counts independently of the status filter. Deleted items are
excluded from the initial view.

Checkboxes select individual rows; **Select all matching** snapshots up to 5,000
matching IDs across every page. The confirmation applies to those IDs only, so
later arrivals cannot be included silently. Items that start or finish before
the action commits are skipped, with individual results. Changing filters clears
the all-matching selection. Actions require the operator role and are audited;
API tokens need `provisioning:write`.

Filters live in the URL for sharing. **Save view** keeps up to 20 named filter
sets in this browser; saving the same name replaces it. Table sorting affects
presentation only.

### Provisioning order

Higher pool priorities receive capacity first. Within a priority tier, pools
with Run now demand come first; otherwise the least recently provisioned pool
gets the first turn. Each backlogged pool gets one slot per allocation round.
Provisioning history includes removed runners, so fast-finishing runners and
controller restarts do not reset fairness. Within each pool, Run now demand
comes before ordinary demand, then oldest queued time, then job ID to break ties.
Pool priority and an explicit Run now preference can defer ordinary work.

This is an order for provisioning capacity. GitHub chooses which compatible job
an available runner actually executes. Open a queue row for its current waiting
explanation, including explicit paused/deleted demand.

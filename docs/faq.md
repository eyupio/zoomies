## What is Zoomies?

Zoomies is a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner fleet controller. You point it at
a GitHub organisation, or at a repository on a personal account; it watches for
queued jobs, starts a fresh runner container for each one, and destroys the
runner when the job finishes. It is a single Go binary with SQLite for state and
a web UI built in.

## Do I need Kubernetes?

No. Zoomies is a process on a machine. There is no cluster, no operator, no
custom resources and no database server -- a VM with a container runtime is the
whole requirement. See the [architecture](architecture.md).

## How is this different from actions-runner-controller?

[ARC](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) is excellent if you
already run Kubernetes. Zoomies is for the case where you do not: a VM or three,
where a Helm chart and a set of CRDs are more machinery than the problem needs,
but hand-registering a few long-lived runners is not enough. The
[comparison table](index.md#why-not-something-else) on the home page is the
short version.

## What does "ephemeral by default" actually buy me?

Each runner takes exactly one job and is then destroyed. Nothing survives from
one workflow run to the next -- not a clone, not a cache, not a credential a
previous job left on disk. It is the single most useful property a self-hosted
runner can have, and it is why it is the default rather than an option.

Destroyed means destroyed on the host, too. A finished runner's container, its
log and its scratch directory are deleted by the agent a few minutes after the
job, once the controller has recorded how it ended; the window is
[`agent.finished_retention`](configuration.md#agentfinished_retention), and it
is there so you can still read a runner's output right after it finishes. A
host that runs a thousand jobs a week does not end the week with a thousand
stopped containers.

## Do I have to paste a runner registration token anywhere?

No. Zoomies authenticates as a GitHub App and mints a single-use JIT
registration for each runner itself. A JIT configuration registers exactly one
runner and cannot be replayed, so there is no long-lived credential sitting in a
dotfile next to a runner. The App's private key is encrypted at rest with
AES-256-GCM.

## Does it scale to zero?

Yes, and that is the default: a pool with `min_runners: 0` runs nothing at all
while its queue is empty. Set `min_runners` above zero only when you want warm
capacity waiting, and always set `max_runners` -- it is the backstop against a
runaway workflow. See [configuration](configuration.md).

## Is it safe to run self-hosted runners on public repositories?

No, and Zoomies does not change that. A self-hosted runner executes code from
your repositories, which on a public repository means code from anyone who can
open a pull request; GitHub's own guidance says not to do it. What Zoomies does
is make each execution's blast radius as small as it reasonably can: one job per
runner, no reusable registration credential on the host, no Docker daemon inside
the job unless you ask for one, a non-root user with dropped capabilities.
[Security](security.md) says what every setting that trades this away costs.

## What happens if the webhook is misconfigured?

The fleet gets slower, not stuck. `workflow_job` webhooks are how Zoomies finds
out about a queued job, and a fallback poller runs behind them, so a delivery
that never arrives means a job picked up on the next poll rather than a job that
sits there forever. Webhook deliveries are at-least-once and can arrive out of
order, and the jobs upsert refuses to move a job backwards through its
lifecycle.

## Can runners run on more than one machine?

Yes. One controller and any number of agents, on any number of hosts. Agents
only ever connect outbound -- they long-poll the controller for tasks and post
results and logs back on connections they opened -- so a runner host behind NAT
needs no inbound firewall rule at all.

## Which container runtimes work?

Docker and Podman, including rootless, and a `process` backend that runs the
runner directly on the host without a container. Zoomies talks to the Engine API
over a socket and Podman's socket speaks the same protocol, so both are the same
code path.

## Can jobs build container images?

Yes, with one setting on the pool: `docker_mode: dind` gives each of its runners
a private Docker daemon. The stock runner image has no Docker CLI on purpose —
most pools never build an image, and the client is cold-start time they would
pay for nothing — so a pool that asks for a daemon is switched to
`ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner-docker`, the same image plus a client, as it is
saved. An image of your own is left alone and has to carry `docker` itself. See
[Jobs that build container
images](configuration.md#jobs-that-build-container-images).

## Which platforms does it run on?

Linux on x86-64 and arm64 is what the controller, the agents and the runner
images are built for. macOS works for running a controller in development.
Windows runners are not supported.

## Does it work with GitHub Enterprise Server?

Yes. Point `github.api_base_url` at your Enterprise Server instance; the App
authentication, the JIT configurations and the webhooks are the same.

## Do I need a GitHub organisation?

No. When you connect GitHub, the target is either an organisation or a single
repository written as `owner/name`. A repository target is how a personal
account is used: the App is created on your own account and installed there,
scoped to that repository, and its runners register at the repository level --
GitHub offers no account-wide runners for personal accounts. Each repository you
want to run jobs for is one installation and one pool, and the installer and
the Connect GitHub dialog both offer the choice.

## How do I move my existing workflows onto it?

The migration wizard rewrites `runs-on` across your repositories and opens one
pull request per repository, showing you the exact diff before it opens
anything, and only touching the jobs it is sure about. See
[migrating repositories](migration.md).

## Can I see what the scheduler is doing, and why?

Yes -- every scaling decision carries a reason string written for a person
("1 job queued", or "3 jobs queued > 30s" once a scale-up delay is set), and it is shown in the UI next to the pool it applies
to. Scheduling is a pure function of a snapshot, which is what makes those
reasons reliable enough to print.

## What does it cost?

Nothing. Zoomies is free and open source under the GNU Affero General Public
License (AGPL-3.0). You pay for the machines you run it on.

## Can I run Zoomies as a service for other people?

Yes. The licence has one thing to say about it: if you change Zoomies and let
other people use your changed version over a network, you have to offer those
people the source of what you are running. That is the clause the AGPL adds to
the GPL, and it is why Zoomies uses it. Running it for your own organisation,
modified or not, asks nothing of you. The full text is in

# Configuring Zoomies

One file, `zoomies.yaml`, and every key can be overridden with a `ZOOMIES_*`
environment variable. Environment wins over file; file wins over defaults.

Zoomies looks for the file at, in order: `--config <path>`,
`$ZOOMIES_CONFIG_DIR/zoomies.yaml`, `/etc/zoomies/zoomies.yaml` when running as
root, otherwise `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zoomies/zoomies.yaml`. If no file exists and
none was named explicitly, defaults plus environment are used — which is what
makes the container image work with nothing but environment variables.

The parser is strict. A misspelled key is an error naming the line, not a
setting that silently does nothing.

## Everything at once

The defaults below are the actual defaults. A file containing only the settings
you want to change is the normal case.

## The settings that matter most

### `server.external_url`

The address GitHub and your browser use. Webhooks are delivered to
`<external_url><github.webhook_path>`, and the OIDC redirect URL is derived from
it.

Without it, Zoomies cannot tell GitHub where to deliver webhooks, so scaling
falls back entirely to polling and reacts in tens of seconds rather than
instantly. It warns about this at startup.

### `server.bind`

Defaults to loopback. If you change it to `0.0.0.0` and leave TLS off, you get a
warning — which is correct behaviour if a reverse proxy terminates TLS, and a
problem otherwise. When you do run behind a proxy, also set
`server.trusted_proxies` so audit entries and login rate limiting see the real
client address instead of your proxy's.

### The setup token

While the instance has no accounts, the controller prints a **setup token** at
startup — on the banner and on a log line beginning `setup token` — and the
first-run page asks for it. It is what stops a controller you have just deployed
from being claimed by whoever loads the page first; an empty database is not, by
itself, proof that you are its owner.

```sh
docker compose logs zoomies | grep 'setup token'
```

It is minted per process and held only in memory, so restarting the controller
prints a new one, and the line stops appearing for good once an account exists.
`zoomies init` and the installer create the first administrator on the console
and never need it.

### `security.encryption_key`

32 bytes, base64 or hex. Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

Supply it through `ZOOMIES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or a `0600` key file. Putting it in
`zoomies.yaml` produces a warning, because anything that can read your config —
backups, configuration management, a support bundle — can then decrypt every
stored secret.

Zoomies refuses to read a key file that is group- or world-readable.

**Back it up, separately from the database.** Losing it means re-entering the
GitHub App private key and webhook secret.

### `github.api_base_url` — GitHub Enterprise Server

```yaml
github:
  api_base_url: https://ghes.example.com/api/v3
```

A bare hostname is accepted and `/api/v3` appended. Everything else — App auth,
JIT configs, webhooks, runner groups — works the same.

### `github.runner_image` — which image tag to run

```yaml
github:
  runner_image: ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner:latest
```

Both images — `ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies` (the controller) and
`ghcr.io/eyupio/zoomies-runner` — are published to GHCR under four kinds of
tag:

| Tag | Points at | Published by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latest` | The tip of `main`, for now | `ci.yml`, on every push to `main` |
| `main` | The tip of `main` | `ci.yml`, on every push to `main` |
| `sha-<commit>` | One exact commit | `ci.yml`, on every push to `main` |
| `vX.Y.Z` | One tagged release | `release.yml`, on a `v*` tag |

`latest` is the default, and until the first release it is the same image as
`main` — Zoomies has no `v*` tag yet, so there is no release for it to point at.
It therefore moves on every merge. Pin `sha-<commit>` when you want an image
that never changes at all.

Once the first release is tagged, `latest` should go back to meaning "the last
release": drop it from the `images` job in `ci.yml`, and let `release.yml` be
the only thing that moves it. Leaving both in place means the next merge to
`main` overwrites the release's `latest` with an untagged build.

The runner image is only rebuilt when something that goes into it changes —
`deploy/Dockerfile.runner` or `deploy/runner-entrypoint.sh` — so its `main` tag
can be older than the controller's, and correctly so.

### Deployment models

`zoomies init` can run Zoomies three ways, and offers only the ones your host can
actually do:

| | What it writes | When to pick it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` | a hardened systemd unit (or a launchd plist) | leanest, starts fastest, and needs no container runtime for the controller itself |
| `compose` | `docker-compose.yml` and a populated `.env` | easiest to upgrade and to move to another host |
| `docker` | an env file and one `docker run` | fewest files, but you manage the run command |

Pass `--deployment native|compose|docker` to skip the question. Compose is the
default when a compose command is present, native otherwise.

The generated `.env` is complete: external URL, a freshly generated encryption
key, bind address, TLS mode, trusted proxies, backend, capacity, work and
database paths, log settings, the image tag, the published port, and the host's
real docker group id. Every variable carries a comment. It is `0600`, written
atomically, and a re-run **reuses the existing encryption key** rather than
minting a new one -- which would render every stored secret undecryptable.

`zoomies uninstall` reads back which deployment was used and tears down the
right thing: `<compose> down` for a compose install (offering `-v`, and saying
plainly that this destroys the database), `stop` and `rm` for a container.

### Behind Cloudflare (or any reverse proxy)

`docker-compose.yml` is set up for this: Cloudflare terminates TLS and proxies
to the origin over plain HTTP on port 80.

```yaml
server:
  bind: 0.0.0.0:8080          # the container port; compose publishes it on 80
  external_url: https://zoomies.sh
  tls:
    mode: off                 # Cloudflare holds the certificate
  trusted_proxies: [ ... ]    # Cloudflare's published ranges
```

Three things follow from that, and getting any of them wrong is quiet rather
than loud:

* **The external URL is `https://`, not `http://`.** It is what the session
  cookie's `Secure` flag is derived from, what the webhook URL is built from,
  and what the UI links to. The container serving HTTP does not change any of
  that.
* **`trusted_proxies` must list Cloudflare's ranges.** Without them the origin
  sees Cloudflare's address on every connection, so the audit log records
  Cloudflare for every action and the login rate limiter throttles the whole
  internet as one client. With them, Zoomies takes the address from
  `CF-Connecting-IP` — which Cloudflare sets and a client cannot override —
  falling back to the right-most non-proxy entry of `X-Forwarded-For`. The
  current list is in `.env.example`; refresh it from
  <https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/> when Cloudflare publishes a change.
* **Only Cloudflare should be able to reach the origin.** Publishing port 80
  puts an unauthenticated webhook endpoint on the public internet with
  Cloudflare merely in front of it, not in the way. Firewall the origin to
  Cloudflare's ranges, or use a Cloudflare Tunnel and publish no port at all.

Zoomies will warn at startup that it is listening without TLS. In this
deployment that warning is expected, and it is the reason the warning says
"if a proxy already terminates TLS, this is expected" rather than treating it
as an error.

### `agent.capacity`

The maximum number of concurrent runners on this host. It is a hard ceiling the
scheduler respects; a pool's `max_runners` cannot exceed the capacity actually
available across matching hosts.

Default is half the CPU count, on the reasoning that a job usually wants more
than one core and the host still has to breathe.

### `agent.docker_host`

Empty autodetects, **preferring a rootless socket**, in this order:

1. `$DOCKER_HOST`
2. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock`
3. `/run/user/<uid>/docker.sock`
4. `~/.docker/run/docker.sock` (Docker Desktop on macOS)
5. `/var/run/docker.sock`

### `agent.labels` and pool host selectors

Agent labels describe a host; a pool's `host_selector` requires them. Every
key/value in the selector must match.

```yaml
# on the GPU box
agent:
  labels: { gpu: "true", zone: "eu-west" }
```

```yaml
# in the pool
host_selector: { gpu: "true" }
```

A join token can carry labels too, and those win. Labels decide which pools'
work a host is offered — and therefore which pools' runner registrations it is
handed — so what the operator minting the token pinned is not something the
machine being enrolled can talk its way out of. Keys the token says nothing
about are still the agent's to declare.

### Re-joining a host

Joining with the name of a host that already exists replaces it: the row keeps
its ID, and the previous registration's runner records go with it. That needs
the agent token the previous registration was issued, which the agent sends from
its credentials file automatically. A rebuilt machine with its state directory
intact therefore re-joins with no ceremony.

If the credentials really are gone, delete the host first:

```sh
zoomies hosts delete host_xxxxxxxx
zoomies agent join https://zoomies.example.com --token <join-token>
```

A join token on its own is deliberately not enough — otherwise anyone trusted to
enrol one machine could seize any other machine by naming itself after it.

### `scheduler.scale_up_delay`

How long a job must have been queued before it counts as demand. `0s` reacts
immediately, which is what you want most of the time. Raise it if your workflows
arrive in bursts that resolve themselves and you would rather not churn runners.

### `scheduler.max_runner_lifetime`

Force-drains a runner that has lived this long and is **not** busy. It catches
runners wedged by something that never finished registering. It never interrupts
a running job.

## Pool settings

Pools live in the database, not in the config file — they are created in the UI,
the CLI or the API. These are their fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Unique. Appears in scaling reasons and runner names. |
| `installation_id` | Which GitHub App installation this pool registers against. |
| `labels` | What `runs-on` must ask for. Normalised to lowercase. |
| `runner_group` | Optional GitHub runner group. |
| `backend` | `docker`, `podman` or `process`. |
| `image` | Runner image for the container backends. |
| `min_runners` | Kept warm even with nothing queued. `0` is usually right. |
| `max_runners` | Hard ceiling. **Always set this** — it is your backstop against a runaway workflow. |
| `idle_timeout` | How long an idle runner waits before being drained. |
| `ephemeral` | One job per runner. Leave it on. |
| `docker_mode` | `none`, `dind`, or `host-socket`. See [security.md](security.md). |
| `resources` | `cpus`, `memory_mb`, `pids_limit` per runner. |
| `host_selector` | Restricts the pool to matching hosts. |
| `env` | Injected into every runner. |
| `run_as_root` | Off. Turning it on is warned about. |
| `enabled` | A disabled pool drains to zero and creates nothing. |

### How a job finds a pool

1. The job's `runs-on` labels are normalised.
2. Labels every runner advertises anyway — `self-hosted`, `linux`, `windows`,
   `macos`, `x64`, `arm`, `arm64` — do not constrain the choice, except that a
   pool declaring a *contradicting* os/arch label is excluded.
3. A pool matches when it provides every remaining label the job asked for.
4. Among matching pools, the most specific wins (fewest surplus labels), with a
   deterministic tie-break by name, so the same job always lands in the same
   pool.

A queued job that matches no enabled pool appears in the Overview's problems
panel. That is almost always a typo in `runs-on` or a label missing from a pool.

## Validation

Every start prints what it found:

```
$ zoomies controller
level=INFO msg="configuration warning" code=bind.public_no_tls setting=server.bind
  title="listening on 0.0.0.0:8080 without TLS"
  detail="session cookies, API tokens and the GitHub App private key you paste during setup all cross the network in cleartext."
  fix="put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front, or set server.tls.mode to self-signed or files."
```

Check a file without starting anything:

```sh
zoomies config check --config /etc/zoomies/zoomies.yaml
zoomies config print          # the effective config, secrets blanked
```

The same findings are served at `GET /api/v1/problems` and rendered in the UI's
problems panel, so a warning cannot be missed just because nobody was reading
the logs the day it appeared.

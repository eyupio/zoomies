 * fifteen-minute point carries each figure's peak, and the most idle runners
 * there were at any moment in a quarter of an hour is not an answer to
 * whether anything was free when the queue was deep. Folded the other way
 * round -- was there a minute in this interval when work waited and nothing
 * was free -- the band survives zooming out, which is the zoom an operator
 * asking "did we run short overnight" is on.
 *
 * Contiguous intervals come back as one run, so the chart shades a spell of
 * starvation as one band rather than a picket fence, and an interval nobody
 * sampled ends the run rather than extending it across the unknown.

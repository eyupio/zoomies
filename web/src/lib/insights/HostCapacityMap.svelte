<!--
  The Host capacity map: every host's utilisation on one chart, live and
  backwards in time.

  Each host is a colour and each measurement is a stroke, so a line is read
  the way the usage chart's are: the colour says which machine, the dash says
  what about it. Everything is a share of the machine -- CPU measured, memory
  measured, load against the CPU count, runners against slots, what the
  scheduler has promised against what it may place on, disk -- so seven
  different figures sit on one 0-100% axis and can be read against each other.
  Only load may pass 100, because a load of twice the CPUs is a real thing and
  is what steps a throttle up. It gets a lane of its own above the axis, on
  its own scale up to the highest load in view: a spike to eight times the
  cores is still drawn as a spike, and the axis everything else is read on
  keeps its room rather than being squashed into the bottom tenth of the chart
  behind thirty labels.

  Two layouts, because two questions get asked of it. Every host on one plot
  answers "which machine is the busy one" -- the lines are read against each
  other, and pointing at one, or at its row below, brings it forward and
  steps the rest back. A plot per host answers "what has this machine been
  doing": each has its own drawing, with the wash under its lead line, and
  the plots share one x axis and one crosshair so a moment is still read
  across the fleet. The choice is remembered, as is every other one here.

  The rows beneath are the legend and the switchboard, and they are also the
  reading: each host's meters show its figures at the moment under the
  crosshair, or now when nothing is being read, so the exact numbers for a
  moment are never only in a card that follows the pointer. The line above
  the chart says what an operator would otherwise have to hunt for -- the
  highest figure in view and where it was, and how many hosts are past the
  pressure line right now.

  The controller writes one sample per host per minute; the stream keeps the
  newest point moving between them, from the same host view the cards below
  are drawn from, so the chart's right-hand edge and the card never disagree.
  A host that stops reporting draws a gap, not a flat line: a flat line is
  what a healthy, quiet machine draws too. One missing minute is not that,
  though -- it is a sampler a moment late or a tab that slept -- so the line
  is drawn across it and only two absent in a row break it.

  The three shortest windows -- the last minute, five, ten -- are drawn ten
  seconds to a point, from what the stream delivers while the page is open,
  because an operator watching a job land wants each heartbeat and not the
  last of every two. Behind them the minute samples are still the history,
  so those windows fill in as the stream arrives.

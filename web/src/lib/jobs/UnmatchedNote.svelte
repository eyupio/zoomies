<!--
  What an unmatched job is, said in full.

  This is the one thing on the Jobs page that an operator cannot work out from
  the row itself: the job is not slow, nothing in this fleet is going to start
  it. The explanation appears wherever unmatched jobs do -- above the grid when
  the filter is on or the page contains one, and again in the drawer.

  It says "this fleet" rather than "never", and it reaches only queued jobs
  whose labels are not GitHub's own or a vendor's. A controller cannot see the
  whole of GitHub: the installation's webhooks cover every job in its
  repositories, and a job on hosted runners, or on another self-hosted provider
  in the same organisation, has labels no pool here claims and runs perfectly
  well. Telling an operator those jobs will never run would be alarming and
  false, so the note names both possibilities and lets them decide which this
  is.

  The one case it can be certain about is a repository no GitHub App
  installation here covers. Then the labels are beside the point -- Zoomies
  holds no credential for that target and could not register a runner there
  whatever a pool advertises -- so the note says that instead, because sending
  an operator to check their runs-on would waste their afternoon.

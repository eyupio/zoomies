  One host.

  A card rather than a table row: a host carries a set of facts that do not fit
  a grid -- capacity, health, backend capabilities and labels -- and there are
  usually few enough hosts that density is not the constraint. Everything an
  operator would act on is here, and the state is carried by a shape and a word
  as well as by a colour.

      A fleet upgraded in step is a fleet where every card carries this, and an
      open copy of the same instructions on each one is three times the card
      for a paragraph that does not differ between them. Kept anywhere above,
      even folded, it also pushes the figures an operator came to compare --
      slots, committed resources, backends -- down by a line on the hosts that
      have it and not on the hosts that do not, so nothing lines up across the

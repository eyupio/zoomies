<!--
  Removing a host.

  The API refuses while the host still has live runners, and its refusal names
  them and says what to do. That message is shown verbatim rather than
  translated, and only then is forcing offered -- with what forcing actually
  means spelled out, since the runners are not stopped by it, they are simply
  no longer anybody's responsibility here.

<!--
  Draining and deleting runners, from the grid and from the detail page.

  Both pages ask the same question, so they ask it in the same words. The two
  distinctions that matter to an operator are stated every time, with the count
  in front of them:

    * draining never interrupts a running job -- the runner finishes what it is
      on and then exits;
    * deleting with "destroy immediately" does interrupt it, and GitHub will
      mark that job failed.

  Typing the name is required only for the destructive combination, which is
  the one that cannot be taken back.

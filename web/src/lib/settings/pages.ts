/**
 * The pages of the Settings section, in the one order they are ever listed
 * in. The rail on a desktop, the strip on a tablet, the list on a phone and
 * the account menu all read from here, so none of them can disagree about what
 * Settings holds or where a page lives.
 *
 * Three groups, by whose thing each page is. "You" is the signed-in person's
 * own account and this browser's preferences, which every role may change.
 * "Access" is who else may sign in. "Controller" is what this instance runs
 * with. The pages needing the administrator role are listed for everybody
 * regardless, marked rather than hidden: a viewer who cannot find the users
 * page should learn why, not conclude the product does not have one.
 *
 * Each page has an address of its own -- /settings/users -- so a page is a
 * link, a bookmark and a place the browser's back button returns to.

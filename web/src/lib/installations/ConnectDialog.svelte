<!--
  Connecting Zoomies to GitHub.

  The App manifest flow is three moves, and each one is explained as it happens
  because the operator is being sent to another site in the middle of it:

    1. Zoomies builds a manifest that asks for exactly the permissions it needs.
    2. The browser posts it to GitHub, which creates the App and hands back a
       code; the exchange turns that code into credentials Zoomies keeps sealed.
    3. The operator installs the App on the organisation, and the installation
       ID that produces is what finally records the connection here.

  There is a second way in for an App that already exists, because an operator
  with a key and an installation ID should not have to make a new App.

  The stepper is hand-rolled rather than the Wizard component: advancing has to
  wait on a request that can fail, and Wizard advances as soon as its handler
  resolves.

        <!--
          The manifest goes to GitHub as a real form in the markup, submitted by
          a real submit button.

          Two things have to hold for the POST to arrive. The form must be a
          real one: a form built in script, submitted with `form.submit()` and
          torn down in the same turn, is not reliably treated as user-initiated
          and can leave the new tab on a blank page. And the page's
          Content-Security-Policy must name GitHub in `form-action`, which the
          controller does (see contentSecurityPolicy in internal/api/router.go).
          That second one was the real cause of the "you have to reload the
          GitHub tab, and then the form is empty" report: a policy of 'self'
          alone makes the browser refuse the submission without a word on
          screen, and reloading turns the POST into a GET, which GitHub answers
          with its blank create-an-App form.

          It sits outside the step form because HTML has no nested forms, and
          the step form is what makes Enter work everywhere else in the dialog.

/**
 * What the Overview's feed can tell an operator, and which of it a browser
 * that has never been asked shows.
 *
 * The feed used to be the scheduler's decisions and nothing else, which made
 * it the only live history in the product and left every other thing worth
 * knowing -- a host that stopped answering, a machine that never became one,
 * a job whose runner died under it -- to be found by opening the page it
 * belongs to. Those are now categories here, and each is a switch on
 * Settings -> Events, because "what belongs on my dashboard" is a question
 * only the operator can answer: a fleet renting machines wants them, a fleet
 * of three fixed hosts never will.
 *
 * Two rules keep the list honest. A category is an *area of the fleet*, not an
 * event kind on the wire -- an operator thinks "hosts", not "host.updated" --
 * and a category never reports a frame that carries no news, so turning one on
 * cannot flood the panel with heartbeats. What makes a frame news is in
 * `changes.ts`.

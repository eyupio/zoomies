<!--
  The grid.

  TanStack Table's core builds the column and row models and owns column
  visibility; every pixel of markup is ours, because a table is where this
  product's density and keyboard behaviour actually live.

  Everything is server side: the fetcher receives the query, returns the page
  and the total, and the query itself lives in the URL so a filtered view can be
  pasted to a colleague. Sorting, paging and filters therefore never touch the
  rows in the browser.

  Keyboard: up and down move between rows, Enter opens, Space selects,
  Shift with the arrows extends the selection, Home and End jump to the ends.

  Label, control, hint and error, wired together.

  it must use, so the error is always announced through `aria-describedby` and
  the label always points at the right thing.

    One message row, so a validation error never reflows the form.

    An error rendered *in addition* to the hint adds a line, which moves
    everything below it -- including the submit button, out from under a pointer
    already on its way down. The click is then delivered to whatever lands in
    its place, and the operator experiences a button that does nothing. So the
    error takes the hint's place, and every field on a form worth clicking
    carries a hint, so the row is occupied before it is needed.

    Anything a field must say *alongside* an error goes in `notice`, which is
    rendered independently. Caps lock is what that exists for.

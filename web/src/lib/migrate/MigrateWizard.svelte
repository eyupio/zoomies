<!--
  Moving a repository's CI onto this fleet.

  Five steps, and the last one is the point: nothing is written until an
  operator has read the exact diff that is about to appear in somebody else's
  repository. The first four exist to make that diff correct -- one answer per
  label for the whole organisation, then the jobs that need a different one --
  and the results screen reports what actually happened, repository by
  repository, with a link to every pull request.

  The wizard holds one plan at a time and re-fetches it whenever an answer that
  changes it changes. That is a round trip per edit, but the alternative --
  rewriting workflows in the browser -- would mean two implementations of the
  rewriting rules that could disagree, and the one that matters is the one on
  the server, because it is the one that commits.

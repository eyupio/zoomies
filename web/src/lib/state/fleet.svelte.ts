/**
 * The live fleet cache.
 *
 * Every page reads from here rather than polling. SSE frames are applied to the
 * collections; a reconnect triggers one authoritative fetch so a replay gap
 * cannot leave the screen wrong.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE, and the reason this file looks the way it does:
 *
 * The rows live in plain `Map`s inside a single `$state.raw`. They are NOT deep
 * reactive state. A busy fleet has thousands of runners, and wrapping each of
 * them in a reactive proxy costs a proxy allocation per row plus a dependency
 * per field read -- which is exactly the shape of jank that makes a dashboard
 * feel slow on a second monitor. Instead the Maps are mutated in place and a
 * version counter is bumped inside a fresh container object; because the
 * container is `$state.raw`, reassigning it invalidates every reader once.
 * Coarse invalidation of a few hundred visible rows is far cheaper than fine
 * invalidation of several thousand invisible ones.
 *
 * Bumps are coalesced on an animation frame, so a burst of forty SSE frames
 * repaints once rather than forty times.
 *
 * Two counters come out of a bump. `version` moves on every change and is what
 * a component reading a row depends on. `shape` moves only when something
 * other than a live metric changed -- a runner appearing, changing state, pool,
 * host or job; a host flipping health -- and is what a server-side grid
 * refetches on. A runner's heartbeat updates its CPU and memory every thirty
 * seconds, and on a fleet of fifty runners that is a frame every second or so;
 * a grid that refetched on each of those would be a round trip per heartbeat,
 * for two columns it can read from this cache instead.

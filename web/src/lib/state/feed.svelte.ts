/**
 * The Overview's feed: what has happened to this fleet lately.
 *
 * It is the one place in the product that answers "what did I miss?" without
 * the operator having to guess which page to open. The panel that used to be
 * here showed the scheduler's decisions alone, which meant a host that went
 * quiet at 03:00, a machine that never became one, and a job whose runner died
 * under it were all found by going and looking.
 *
 * Three things feed it, and they are different on purpose:
 *
 *  * **Derived** from the live fleet cache -- the scheduler's decisions and the
 *    runners that failed. Both are already fetched and already kept live there,
 *    so deriving costs nothing and a reconnect's reconcile repairs them for
 *    free.
 *  * **Fetched once**, when a category that has a past is first shown: the
 *    recent failed jobs, and the audit log. Without this a tab opened at nine
 *    in the morning claims nothing has happened since the controller started.
 *  * **Captured** from the event stream for everything else, because hosts,
 *    machines, pools, installations and deliveries have no history endpoint
 *    shaped like a feed. Those categories say so on the settings page rather
 *    than looking broken.
 *
 * Entry ids are stable for the *fact* rather than the frame, so a fetch and
 * the replay it overlaps with produce one line rather than two.
 *
 * What is captured is bounded (`CAPACITY`) and lives only in this tab: the
 * feed is a window on the fleet, not a log, and the pages it links to are
 * where the whole of anything is.

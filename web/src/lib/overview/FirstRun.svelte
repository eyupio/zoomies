<!--
  The first three things, and nothing else.

  A brand-new administrator used to land on an Overview of four zeroes whose
  only call to action was "Create a pool" -- which opens a wizard that refuses
  on its first step, because a pool belongs to a GitHub App installation and
  there is not one yet. The single action the product offered a new operator
  was a guaranteed round trip through a dead end, and the step that actually
  had to happen first was discoverable only by noticing a word in the nav.

  So: three numbered steps, each ticked from real fleet state, each with the
  one action that advances it. A step that cannot be done yet says why rather
  than offering a button that leads to a refusal.

  It disappears for good once a job has run here, because at that point the
  fleet works and a checklist on the dashboard is clutter. The dismissal is
  per-browser: it is a nudge, not a setting, and it costs nothing to see again
  on another machine.

  It does not vanish silently, though. The first job is the moment the whole
  checklist exists for, and a screen an operator has followed for five steps
  that simply goes blank when it happens is a strange way to be told it worked.
  If the checklist was on screen when that job started, it gives way to a line
  saying so, and then to the two numbers the product is judged on: how long the
  job waited for a runner, and how long it ran.

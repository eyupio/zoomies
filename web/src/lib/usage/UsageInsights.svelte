<!--
  The Usage page's charts: the report as a trend, the groups that used the
  most, and the calendar of squares.

  The trend used to draw one fixed set of lines, chosen from a dropdown, into
  a fixed picture stretched to whatever width the panel had, with a label at
  each end and nothing in between. It is the Overview's fleet activity chart
  now -- literally the same drawing, and the same chips and rows around it --
  and so it reads the way the capacity map does: a figure per chip, drawn one
  unit to a pixel, on an axis of round numbers, with the times along the
  bottom on round hours and midnights. Pointing at a line singles it out; the
  rows beneath are the legend, the switchboard and the reading at once.

  Where a pool had nowhere to put a runner, the chart is shaded. It is this
  panel's version of the fleet trend's starvation band: the report already
  counts those minutes -- the matrix can colour its squares by them -- and
  "the work arrived and the fleet had no room for it" is what an operator
  scanning a fortnight is looking for.

  Two measures rather than one chart, because jobs and hours do not share an
  axis. And the crosshair reads a moment rather than choosing one: choosing
  is the matrix's job, since selecting a day there fetches that day's hours,
  and a finger dragged across a month would otherwise ask for thirty of them.
  A square chosen in the matrix does move the crosshair here, which is the
  direction that costs nothing.

<!--
  Step five: how much machine one runner gets, and how much disk its cache may
  keep.

  It is a step of its own, after the hosts and before the count, because that
  is the order the decision is actually made in: these are the machines, this
  is what one runner of mine costs on them, and therefore this is how many
  there can be. Asked the other way round -- a maximum typed first, a size
  typed last -- the number that mattered was chosen before anything on screen
  could say what it would buy.

  There are two answers, and the first one is the usual one. A pool that names
  no size is given one slot's share of whichever host each runner lands on --
  charged against that host and applied as a real cgroup limit, so the books
  and the cgroups agree -- which is correct on every machine in an unequal
  fleet without anybody typing a number. A fixed size is for the pool whose
  jobs need a particular amount of machine wherever they run.

  What is not an answer is "no limit at all". A runner with no limit takes
  every core on the machine it lands on while the fleet charges it one slot's
  share, so the host reads as half committed, its daemon stops answering, and
  the creates queued behind it time out on a machine every page calls busy.
  Neither choice here does that.

  The fixed figures are sliders rather than boxes. A box invites 3000 MB as
  readily as 4096 and says nothing about whether any host can back it; a notch
  is a value somebody has a reason to choose, and the count underneath says
  what choosing it costs.

    Both answers belong here, under the sliders, while there is still a reason
    to move them: a size is the one setting on this form that costs a host
    quietly. The fit says which machines this size has just put out of reach,
    in the fleet's own words; the room says how many runners the rest can hold.

    They are shown for both answers. An automatic pool can still be refused by
    a host -- for its backend, its platform, or a share that falls under what a
    runner needs to be a runner -- and that is exactly as worth knowing.

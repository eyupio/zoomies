 * Renaming a pool later does not un-write the workflows that already point at
 * it. So the wizard fills one in instead.
 *
 * The name it fills in is the pool's shape -- `zoomies-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`, the
 * grammar in docs/naming.md -- because that is what a workflow author reading a
 * `runs-on` needs to know before they send a job to it, and because it is the
 * same name `zoomies init` suggests for a machine of that size. The wizard used
 * to lead with a kennel word instead, which left an operator who met both with
 * two conventions for one thing.
 *
 * The spaniel is still here, and still earns its place: it is what tells two
 * pools of the same shape apart, and what names a pool created before anything
 * about it is known. The brand prefix is not optional either -- it is what marks
 * a runner in the GitHub UI as ours rather than GitHub's.

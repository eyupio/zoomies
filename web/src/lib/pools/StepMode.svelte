<!--
  Step one: how much of this pool you want to decide.

  It is the first screen because it is the first decision, and because the two
  answers lead to genuinely different amounts of work. A fleet's first pool
  needs a name, a target and a label; every other figure on the old seven-step
  form had a right answer the controller already knew and was asking for
  anyway. Making someone walk past five screens of correct defaults to reach
  the review step taught them that those screens matter, which is the opposite
  of true.

  The two cards say what each path *does* rather than how long it is, because
  "simple" and "advanced" are only meaningful next to what they decide. The
  automatic card names the share these hosts would actually hand a runner --
  computed from the fleet in front of the operator, not from a constant -- so
  the claim is checkable on the screen that makes it.

  An edit never reaches this step. The pool has already answered the question,
  the wizard reads the answer off it to choose a path, and an operator who
  opened a pool to change one setting should not have to pass a screen about
  how much of it they want to decide.

    <h3>What this fleet decides for you</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Size</strong> — each runner is given one slot's share of whichever host it lands on,
        as a real limit rather than a promise.
        {#if !hostsKnown}
          The share is worked out per host.
        {:else if shares.length === 0}
          The share is worked out once a host has reported what machine it is.
        {:else if spread && smallest && largest}
          Today that is {share(smallest)} on
          <code>{smallest.host}</code>, and {share(largest)} on <code>{largest.host}</code> — one pool,
          sized correctly on both.
        {:else if smallest}
          Today that is {share(smallest)} on
          {pluralise(shares.length, 'host')}.
        {/if}
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hosts</strong> — any machine in the fleet that can run it. Nothing is excluded, so a host
        added next month picks up this pool's work without an edit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backend and image</strong> — Docker, on the published runner image for the host's platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Timings</strong> — this fleet's own, and they keep following it when you change them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="after">
      All of it is editable afterwards. Switching to advanced never loses anything you have already
      typed.

    <h3>What you will be asked</h3>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Backend</strong> — Docker, Podman or the host itself, and the runner image.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Size</strong> — a fixed CPU and memory limit on every host, or the automatic share.

      <li><strong>Scaling</strong> — how many runners, and how long an idle one waits.</li>

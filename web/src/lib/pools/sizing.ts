/**
 * The notches a runner's size moves between, and the words for them.
 *
 * Pure, and imported by a unit test. The sliders exist because the three
 * figures they carry -- how much of a machine one runner gets, and how much
 * disk its cache may keep -- are the settings an operator is least equipped to
 * type into an empty box: a number field accepts 3000 MB as readily as 4096,
 * and neither the field nor the pool says which of them the hosts can actually
 * back. A notch is a value somebody has a reason to choose.
 *
 * The arithmetic that says how many runners a fleet has room for is the
 * controller's, not this file's: what a runner is charged is not always what
 * the pool says -- a docker-in-docker slot is charged for its sidecar too --
 * and a browser that worked it out again would disagree with where the fleet
 * actually places runners. This file's counting is only what a slider needs
 * before the server's answer lands.

<!--
  Step seven: the runner timings this pool disagrees with the fleet about.

  Every control here is empty by default, and empty is the answer that means
  something: the pool follows the fleet, and keeps following it when the fleet's
  figure is changed on the Settings page. A wizard that pre-filled these with
  the fleet's values would look identical and behave differently -- every pool
  frozen on whatever the fleet meant the day it was made -- so the figures are
  shown as placeholders instead, where they can be read but not accidentally
  adopted.

  The settings are here rather than on the Scaling step because they answer a
  different question. Scaling is how many runners and for how long they idle,
  which an operator sets from the shape of their queue. These are how long each
  step of a runner's own life is allowed to take, which an operator sets from
  the shape of their images -- and the pool that needs them is usually the one
  pulling twelve gigabytes of Windows, not the one that queues oddly.

    The one relationship between these settings that is worth catching before
    the server does.

    A provision timeout inside the time a runner legitimately takes to start --
    the agent's create budget plus this pool's own Docker wait -- fails runners
    that are still coming up, and the replacement pulls the same image over the
    link that was slow to begin with. The fleet's own defaults are held out of
    that order by a test; a pool that overrides either half is not, which is
    exactly what this panel makes possible.

    It is a caution rather than an error: the server raises the same thing as a
    pool warning, and there are fleets whose images are already on every host
    where a shorter timeout is a reasonable thing to want. Saying it here means
    it is read while the number is being chosen rather than afterwards.

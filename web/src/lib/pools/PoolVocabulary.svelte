<!--
  The words the pool pages share: backend and Docker-mode names, the wizard's
  steps, and the human label for every field the API can reject.

  This file has no markup on purpose. The wizard, the pools grid and the pool
  detail page all need the same vocabulary, and an operator who reads "Host
  socket" in a table and then "host-socket" in a wizard has to work out that
  they are the same thing. Keeping the strings here means they cannot drift --
  and it keeps the wizard's steps importable without the steps importing the
  wizard back.

   * timings this pool disagrees with the fleet about.

   * audiences want different things from the same screen. Someone adding their

   * timeout wants every control in front of them, and neither is served by

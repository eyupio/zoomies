<!--
  Step six: how many runners, and for how long.

  It comes after the size on purpose. A maximum is a number about machines --
  it means something only once it is known what one runner costs and what the
  hosts can hold -- and asked first it was a number typed into an empty box
  with nothing on screen able to say what it would buy. By the time this step
  is reached the fleet has an answer, so the maximum starts at what the hosts
  can actually place and says where the figure came from.

  It stays a figure rather than becoming "as many as fit". The maximum is a
  backstop: it is what stops one misconfigured workflow, or one repository
  under a fork-pull-request storm, filling every machine and every rented one
  behind it. A cap that silently grew with the fleet would be a cap nobody
  chose, so the fleet's room is offered and an operator accepts it.

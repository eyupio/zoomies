<!--
  The Overview: the one page that has to earn a place on a second monitor.

  Reading order is deliberate. The four numbers say what the fleet is doing;
  anything that needs a person comes immediately after them, because a problem
  found at the bottom of a page is a problem found late. Then the two things an
  operator watches when nothing is wrong -- where the capacity is going, and
  what the scheduler decided -- and finally the work itself.

  What needs a person is one line here rather than a full panel. The list it
  summarises lives in the problems drawer, reachable from the top bar on every
  page: a fleet whose deliberate configuration warnings pushed its pools and its
  running jobs below the fold was answering "what is happening right now?" with
  a month-old decision.

  On a desktop the pools and the running jobs share the left-hand column and
  the scaling feed takes the right, cut to their height. The feed is the one
  panel whose length says nothing about the fleet -- ten decisions is ten
  decisions whether there is one pool or twenty -- so letting it set the height
  of the row left a fleet with one pool looking at a screen of blank space
  under it. The decisions that do not fit are a scroll away, inside the panel.
  A phone stacks everything, in reading order.

  How the last jobs ended comes last, across the width of the page: it is the
  recent past rather than the present, and it is where "is CI broken?" gets
  answered -- and where a runner that died under a job is called the fleet's
  failure rather than the workflow's.

  Nothing on this page polls, and nothing on it can be refreshed by hand. The
  fleet cache subscribes to `stats`, `scaling`, `problems.updated`, `runner.*`,
  `pool.*` and `host.*`; the panels below add `job.updated` for the running
  jobs and the recent outcomes. A reconnect ends in one reconciling fetch,
  which is the only fetch that ever happens twice.

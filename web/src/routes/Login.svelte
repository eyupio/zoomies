<!--
  Sign in.

  What this renders is decided by `/meta`, which is safe to call before anyone
  is authenticated: a password form, an SSO button, both, or -- when
  authentication has been switched off in the configuration -- a plain statement
  of that fact rather than a form that would do nothing.

  This is the first screen anyone sees, and often the only one they see while
  something is wrong, so it does the small things properly: the cursor starts in
  the first empty field, caps lock is called out before it costs an attempt, the
  password can be revealed, and a failure says which kind of failure it was --
  wrong credentials, too many attempts, or a controller that cannot be reached
  at all. Those are three different problems and only one of them is the
  operator's fault.

  It is also the one page of a controller that people who did not install it
  see, so it is split in two: the form, and a Zoomies Black panel that says
  what this is, who makes it and where the source lives. The panel is the
  brand's own ground in both themes, which is what lets the lockup sit on it
  with no holding shape of its own.

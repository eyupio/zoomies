<!--
  Jobs: what has run, what is running, and what is waiting.

  The page exists to answer two questions. "Why is this slow?" is answered by
  sorting on queue wait or duration, which is why those two columns are sorted
  by the server rather than by the browser -- the interesting job is rarely on
  the page you are looking at. "Why has this not started?" is answered by the
  unmatched filter, which finds the queued jobs no enabled pool claims. A job
  that already ran is never counted there: its labels may name a hosted or vendor
  runner Zoomies does not own, and something ran it. Neither is a job
  whose labels all name such a runner, however long it queues -- a vendor is
  about to start it, and this fleet was never in the running.

  This is the Workflows page one step down: every job on a row of its own,
  where Workflows has the run each belongs to. The two share their filters and
  their views, so a link into either means the same on the other; what differs
  is the question. A run is what an operator arrives with from a pull request,
  and a job is what a pool claimed, a runner ran and a queue wait belongs to --
  which is why every link that names a job still lands here.

  GitHub reports every job in an installed repository, most of which this fleet
  never touches. The page therefore shows Zoomies' own work by default -- jobs a
  pool claims, jobs its runners ran, and queued jobs nothing here claims that
  something here could have -- and the "Include other runners" switch widens it
  to everything GitHub has reported.

  Status is the filter this page is opened for, so it is a row of buttons above
  the grid rather than a menu to open, and a page nobody has asked anything of
  answers "what is running?" before being asked. That default holds for a bare
  visit only: a link that already carries a filter -- the problems panel's, the
  Overview's, a colleague's -- said what it wanted, and narrowing it to running
  would answer a different question.

  The note explaining unmatched jobs belongs to the filtered view, not to the
  default one. An organisation that also rents runners elsewhere keeps queueing
  jobs this fleet has no pool for, and the ones whose labels leave any doubt are
  counted here because nothing here ran them -- so a note above the default grid
  is a standing red warning about somebody else's work, which is the one thing
  this page must not do. Discovery is the problems panel's job: `jobs.unmatched`
  waits out a grace period first, and its link opens this page with the filter
  already on.

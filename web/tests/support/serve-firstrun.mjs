// The first-run fixture: authentication on, an empty database, no external URL.
//
// The monitoring harness (serve.mjs) runs with authentication off and a seeded
// demo fleet, which is exactly right for the monitoring pages and exactly wrong
// for the first-run ones: `session.boot()` short-circuits to `ready` on an
// auth-disabled instance, so the bootstrap card and the sign-in card are
// unreachable, and a seeded fleet is never an unconfigured one. Every defect
// the first-run review found lived in that blind spot.
//
// This is the state a fresh `docker compose up` actually produces.

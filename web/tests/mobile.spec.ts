 * The reported bug, and the class it belongs to.
 *
 * A mobile browser answers a page that overflows sideways by laying the whole
 * thing out in a wider block and showing it smaller, and every `position:
 * fixed` overlay is laid out against that block rather than against the
 * screen. One row a few pixels past the edge is therefore not one row: the
 * problems drawer sized itself against an 800px block, anchored to the
 * right-hand end of it, and an operator on a 412px phone was left looking at a
 * sliver of a panel whose close button was off the side of the screen. The
 * side menu, the command palette, the dialogs and the bottom navigation all
 * sit in the same block and all go with it.
 *
 * The page is widened here deliberately rather than by finding a page that
 * does it, because the fix is not "no page is ever too wide" -- the rest of
 * this file is what protects that. It is that an overlay covers the window
 * whatever the page underneath it has done. Each one is opened first and the
 * page widened under it, which is both the order an operator meets this in and
 * the only order a test can use: once the page is laid out at twice the size,
 * the bottom bar is past the foot of the window as far as a click is

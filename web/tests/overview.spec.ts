/**
 * The Overview.
 *
 * This is the page an operator leaves open on a second monitor, so what it
 * protects is the promise that looking at it is enough: four numbers with an
 * hour of shape behind them, everything that needs a person listed with the
 * fix beside it, which pools cannot grow, and the scheduler's own words for
 * why runners appeared. The refresh button is here too, but what is protected
 * about it is that it is never load-bearing: the numbers arrive on their own,
 * and pressing it changes nothing about what the page says.

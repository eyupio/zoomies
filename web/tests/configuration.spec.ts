/**
 * Settings: the configuration.
 *
 * This is the page that can change what the controller is, so the things worth
 * testing are the ones that stop it doing that by accident: that a change is
 * kept rather than lost at the next restart, that a value nothing can apply
 * says so instead of pretending, that a setting an environment variable is
 * holding is out of the way and explained rather than editable and futile, and
 * that a bad value is refused with a sentence somebody can act on.
 *
 * Every test puts back what it changed. The fixture's controller is shared with
 * the rest of the suite, and a retention window or a scheduler interval left
 * altered is a change every later spec runs against.

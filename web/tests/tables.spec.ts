 * Every default table fits the window it is shown in.

 * A table that scrolls sideways hides the column somebody is looking for behind
 * a gesture they have no reason to try, and takes the row's name off the left
 * edge the moment they do -- so the value they scrolled to belongs to a row they
 * can no longer name. The grids therefore divide whatever width there is and
 * truncate, and on a phone each row becomes a card and reads down instead.
 *
 * This is the file that holds that to be true, at the widths the product claims
 * to support: the reference desktop, the two documented breakpoints and either
 * side of them, and the two phone widths the mobile project uses.
 *
 * Two layouts are exempt, and say so where they are measured: a phone whose grids
 * are left in the row layout they start in scrolls its table inside the grid's
 * own frame, because ten columns do not divide 360 pixels. That is the trade
 * the layout exists to make and the reason Cards is one press away; what is
 * never exempt is the page, which is measured here in both layouts. The other
 * is a desktop layout the operator deliberately widened: that table scrolls in
 * its frame rather than silently shrinking some other column behind the
 * resize handle.

/**
 * The Jobs grid.
 *
 * The page answers two operator questions, and this protects both. "Why is
 * this slow?" needs the queue wait and the run duration on every row. "Why has
 * this not started?" needs the unmatched filter to find the job no pool claims
 * and, more importantly, to say in full what that means -- an unmatched job is
 * not slow, nothing in this fleet is going to start it, and that is the one
 * thing the row itself cannot tell you.
 *
 * The same warning must stay off every job that already ran. A repository still
 * on a hosted-runner vendor produces jobs with labels no pool here claims, and
 * they run perfectly well; flagging them turned the page into a wall of red
 * during exactly the migration this fleet exists to make.

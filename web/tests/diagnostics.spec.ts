/**
 * The pages an operator opens on their worst day.
 *
 * Every other spec runs against a fleet with nothing wrong with it, and that is
 * the right fixture for the grids and the wrong one for everything that
 * explains a fault. The demo deliberately keeps its two starting runners young
 * so an instance left open never reports a problem it does not have -- which
 * left the problems drawer, both stuck-runner shapes, a pool nothing can place
 * and a job GitHub is holding with nothing to render, and so untested. This
 * project runs against the same fleet with ZOOMIES_SEED_STUCK on top.
 *
 * What it protects is the diagnosis rather than the styling. A runner stuck in
 * `registering` has two unrelated causes and the page has to say which one this
 * is; a pool nothing can place is a misconfiguration rather than a busy fleet,
 * and the advice differs; a held job is not this fleet's fault at all.
